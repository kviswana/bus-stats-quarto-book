While R offers a great deal of functionality, we will be using a limited subset that suffices for the course topics. In particular, we will be using a specific R package that contains all the functions and data we need for the course. You should install R and RStudio using the instructions provided in @sec-appendices. That section also shows you how to use RStudio and how to load a package -- specificaly the LSTbook package -- into R.\n\n## R Data Frames\nIn R, we generally represent data in a simple tabular structure named *data frame* -- a table with rows and columns. @tbl-boston-marathon shows an example of some initial rows from the Boston_marathon data frame contained in the LSTbook package.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-boston-marathon .cell tbl-cap='Boston Marathon data (first 10 rows).'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| year|name                       |country       |time     |sex  | minutes|\n|----:|:--------------------------|:-------------|:--------|:----|-------:|\n| 2022|Evans Chebet               |Kenya         |02:06:51 |male |     127|\n| 2021|Benson Kipruto             |Kenya         |02:09:51 |male |     130|\n| 2019|Lawrence Cherono           |Kenya         |02:07:57 |male |     128|\n| 2018|Yuki Kawauchi              |Japan         |02:15:58 |male |     136|\n| 2017|Geoffrey Kirui             |Kenya         |02:09:37 |male |     130|\n| 2016|Lemi Berhanu               |Ethiopia      |02:12:45 |male |     133|\n| 2015|Lelisa Desisa              |Ethiopia      |02:09:17 |male |     129|\n| 2014|Mebrahtom \"Meb\" Keflezighi |United States |02:08:37 |male |     129|\n| 2013|Lelisa Desisa              |Ethiopia      |02:10:22 |male |     130|\n| 2012|Wesley Korir               |Kenya         |02:12:40 |male |     133|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe first define the term *data frame* and then explain some terms that the definitoion uses.\n\n::: {.callout-definition}\n**Data frame:** *A structured dataset organized as rows and columns, where rows correspond to individual observations and columns correspond to variables, with each column containing values of the same type.*\n:::\n\nA data frame contains data about some topic. Each row represents an occurence of the topic. For example, @tbl-boston-marathon contains data about the results of the Boston Marathon over the years. Each row represents the result for one year, for one gender. We also refer to a row as an *observation*, or as an *instance*, or in a medical or biology context, as a *specimen*.\n\nEach column represents some attribute of interest about instances. In @tbl-boston-marathon, we have columns to represent the year of the race, the name, county and sex of the winner and the finishing time.\n\nIn statistics, we generally refer to columns of a data frame as *variables*. We explain why in @sec-variables.\n\nIn the 1880's, Francis Galton was developing ways to quantify the heritability of traits. As part of this work, he collected data on the heights of adult children and their parents. @tbl-galton shows the initial few rows of that data. \n\n\n::: {#tbl-galton .cell tbl-cap='Galton data (first 10 rows).'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|family | father| mother|sex | height| nkids|\n|:------|------:|------:|:---|------:|-----:|\n|1      |   78.5|   67.0|M   |   73.2|     4|\n|1      |   78.5|   67.0|F   |   69.2|     4|\n|1      |   78.5|   67.0|F   |   69.0|     4|\n|1      |   78.5|   67.0|F   |   69.0|     4|\n|2      |   75.5|   66.5|M   |   73.5|     4|\n|2      |   75.5|   66.5|M   |   72.5|     4|\n|2      |   75.5|   66.5|F   |   65.5|     4|\n|2      |   75.5|   66.5|F   |   65.5|     4|\n|3      |   75.0|   64.0|M   |   71.0|     2|\n|3      |   75.0|   64.0|F   |   68.0|     2|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn @tbl-galton, each row represents an adult child. The variables in this data frame represent the father's height (*father*), mother's height (*mother*), sex of the adult child (*sex*), height of the adult child (*height*), and the number of children (*nkinds*) in the family. Each family also has a unique number for each family (*family*).\n\n## Variables {#sec-variables}\n\nIf we look at a column of a data frame, say the column *time* in @tbl-boston-marathon, we see that each row can potentially have a different value in this column. More generally, the values in a column of a data frame can *vary* from row to row -- no wonder we call columns of a data frame *variables*. Going forward, we will use the term *variable* to refer to a column of a data frame.\n\nIn this course, you will be working with many data frames. You should always be sure to understand what a row of a data frame contains information about. In the case of @tbl-boston-marathon, each row rewpresents the results of one race. In the case of @tbl-galton, each row represents one adult child. We use the term *unit of measurement* to refer to the object or concept about which each row stores information.\n\n## Numerical and Categorical Variables\n\nIn @tbl-boston-marathon, the variable *minutes* has values that are numbers. We can such variables *numerical* variables. On the other hand, the variable *sex* can take on only the values *male* and *female* which are not numeric. Similarly, the variable *country* can also take on non-numetic values. We call such variables -- those that take on non-numerical values *categorical*. The individual values of a particular categorical variable are called *levels*. Thus the values *mal* and *female* are the *levels* of the variable *sex* and the country names like *Kenya*, *Japan* and *Ethiopia* are the levels of the variable *country*.\n\n## Data Frames in R\n\nIn this section we look at the practical side of data frames -- using them in R. We will only look at using data frames that are built in to the LSTbook package and mecome available as soon as we load the package LSTbook. If you have not already done so, you should install R and RStudio and learn how o use RStudio using the instructions from @sec-appendices.\n\n### Viewing the first few rows of a data frame\n\nIn an RStudio command prompt you can enter the name of the data frame to get a preview of its contents.\n\n\n::: {.cell fontsize='tiny'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBoston_marathon\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 175 x 6\n    year name       country time     sex   minutes\n   <dbl> <chr>      <chr>   <time>   <chr>   <dbl>\n 1  2022 \"Evans Ch~ Kenya   02:06:51 male     127.\n 2  2021 \"Benson K~ Kenya   02:09:51 male     130.\n 3  2019 \"Lawrence~ Kenya   02:07:57 male     128.\n 4  2018 \"Yuki Kaw~ Japan   02:15:58 male     136.\n 5  2017 \"Geoffrey~ Kenya   02:09:37 male     130.\n 6  2016 \"Lemi Ber~ Ethiop~ 02:12:45 male     133.\n 7  2015 \"Lelisa D~ Ethiop~ 02:09:17 male     129.\n 8  2014 \"Mebrahto~ United~ 02:08:37 male     129.\n 9  2013 \"Lelisa D~ Ethiop~ 02:10:22 male     130.\n10  2012 \"Wesley K~ Kenya   02:12:40 male     133.\n# i 165 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet us understand the output above. The first row says:  \n\n```\n# A tibble: 175 × 6\n```\n\nThis says that the data frame (also called *tibble*) has 175 rows and 6 columns.\n\nThe second line mentiones the column (variable) names. The third line has sone specific notation within angle brackets below each variable. This is telling us what type of value is stored in each column. \n- <dbl> means that the value in a column is a *double*, that is, number that could potentially have a fractional part.\n- <chr> means that the column has character or non-numeric values\n- <time> tells us that the column stores a time\n- and so on.\n\nIf the data frame has many columns and all of them will not fit in our output width, it will only display the columns that will fit and provide information below about the additional columns. In the present case all columns do fit and so there is not additional information provided.\n\n\n### Functions\nYou are likely familiar with the term *functions* as used in mathematics -- you rpovide an input to the function and it performs some computation and provides an output. For example, we might have a function that takes a number as input and produces its square as output. Given the number 5 as input, it will produce the number 25 as its output. Given the number 1.5 as input, it will produce its square 2.25 as its output.\n\nPictorially we might represent a function as a box that has one or more inputs and produces a single output. (We can also have functions that take no inputs and produce an output, but we will not worry about them now.) See @fig-function-1.\n\n![A function that squares its input](../../images/function-1.png){#fig-function-1 width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe might have functions that take more than one input. For example, a function might take two inputs x and y, and produce 23 + 3x + 4y as output. @fig-function-2 shows a function with two inputs.\n\n![A function that computes 23+3x+4y where x and y are its inputs](../../images/function-2.png){#fig-function-2 width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIn computing, we commonly refer to a function's inputs as its *arguments*. @fig-function-3 illustrates this.\n\n![We generally refer to a function's inputs as its *arguments* -- this function has two arguments, x and y](../../images/function-3.png){#fig-function-3 width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe functions we considered in our examples thus far in @fig-function-1, @fig-function-2, and @fig-function-3 have been so simple that we were able to show the actual computation in the box representing the function. Most functions we use in real-life are more complex and we give them evocative names. In such cases, it makes more sense to place the name of the function in the box.   @fig-function-4 shows a generirc repesentation of a function named *cost* with three arguments named *arg1*, *arg2*, and *arg3*.\n\n![Generic representation of a function named *cost* that has three arguments](../../images/function-4.png){#fig-function-4 width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWhen we use a function to perform some computation, we are said to *invoke* the function. We generally invoke a function by using its name and by supplying the argument values in parentheses, as @fig-function-5 shows. We also use the term *passing arguments* to functions to refer to the act of supplying the inputs to a function. We also refer to the result of a function as its *return value*. We will also speak of a function as *returning* something. @fig-function-5 also shows that a function argumnent can be numeric or non-numeric.\n\n![Invoking a named function and storing the function's return value in a variable named *total*](../../images/function-5.png){#fig-function-5 width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIn the next section, we look at using functions to perform computing in R. At that time we will look at a different way of passing arguments to functions.\n\nAlmost all forms of computing, including statistical computing, make significant use of functions. In this course, many of the functions we use take data frame as input and produce a data frame as output. Let us now look at how we use functions in R to work with data and to perform statistical computations.\n\n\n## Using R functions\n\nWe will now look at some common R functions that we will use repeatedly in this course.\n\n### *nrow* \n\nWe will consider the *nrow()* function that allows us to find out how many rows a data frame contains. We pass a data frame as argument to the *nrow()* function and it returns a number specifying how many rows the argument data frame has. For example, to find out how many rows the Boston_marathon data frame has, we can use the following code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrow(Boston_marathon)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 175\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the code above, we used the style of function invocation that @fig-function-5 introduced.\n\n### The *pipe* operator\n\nIn this course we also use another method of passing an argument to a function -- via *pipes*. Let us first see the code and then learn how it works. We will invoke the *nrow()* function again, but using a different approach. The code below does exactly what the earlier code accomplished -- finding the number of rows in a data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBoston_marathon |> nrow()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 175\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the code above, we are still passing the Boston_marathon data frame as an argument to the *nrow()* function, but we are passing it along a *pipe* which appears in the code as \"|>\". \n\n@fig-pipe-1 clarifies code.\n\n![Using the pipe operator to supply the Boston_marathon data frame as an argument to the norw function](../../images/pipe-1.png){#fig-pipe-1 width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe pipe operator \"|>\" has the effect of *injecting* whatever appears on its left hand side as an argument to the function on the right hand side. @fig-pipe-2 makes this very explicit by literally depicting the pipe operator \"|>\" as a physical pipe.\n\n![Seeing the pipeoprtator literally as a pipe though which the argument flows into a function](../../images/pipe-2.png){#fig-pipe-2 width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n  \nGoing forward, we will use this pipe approach extensively, but also mix in the earlier approach in places. You will catch on to our patters pretty easily.\n\n### *ncol*\n\nWe can use the *ncol()* function to find the number of columns in a data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBoston_marathon |> ncol()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above shows us that the Boston_marathon data frame has 6 columns or variables.\n\n### *head* \n\nYou can use the *head()* function to preview the first several rows of a data frame. This time we will use the *Births2022* data frame from the LSTbook package. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBirths2022 |> head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 x 38\n  month dow   place  paternity meduc feduc married\n  <chr> <ord> <chr>  <chr>     <ord> <ord> <chr>  \n1 05    Sat   hospi~ <NA>      Assoc HS    NA     \n2 09    Mon   hospi~ <NA>      <NA>  <NA>  NA     \n3 06    Thurs hospi~ N         HS    <NA>  not_ma~\n4 05    Thurs hospi~ Y         Mast~ Bach~ married\n5 08    Thurs hospi~ <NA>      HS    HS    NA     \n6 01    Tues  hospi~ Y         HS    <NA>  not_ma~\n# i 31 more variables: fage <dbl>, mage <dbl>,\n#   total_kids <int>, interval <ord>,\n#   prenatal_start <ord>, prenatal_visits <dbl>,\n#   mheight <dbl>, wt_pre <dbl>,\n#   wt_delivery <dbl>, diabetes_pre <chr>,\n#   diabetes_gest <chr>, hbp_pre <chr>,\n#   hbp_gest <chr>, eclampsia <chr>, ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above previewed the first six rows of *Births2022* by default because we did not specify how many rows we wanted. We can specify that explicitly. The following previews the first 10 rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBirths2022 |> head(10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 x 38\n   month dow   place paternity meduc feduc married\n   <chr> <ord> <chr> <chr>     <ord> <ord> <chr>  \n 1 05    Sat   hosp~ <NA>      Assoc HS    NA     \n 2 09    Mon   hosp~ <NA>      <NA>  <NA>  NA     \n 3 06    Thurs hosp~ N         HS    <NA>  not_ma~\n 4 05    Thurs hosp~ Y         Mast~ Bach~ married\n 5 08    Thurs hosp~ <NA>      HS    HS    NA     \n 6 01    Tues  hosp~ Y         HS    <NA>  not_ma~\n 7 07    Mon   hosp~ <NA>      <NA>  <NA>  NA     \n 8 11    Thurs hosp~ <NA>      Bach~ Bach~ NA     \n 9 03    Sat   hosp~ <NA>      HS+   <NA>  NA     \n10 08    Fri   hosp~ <NA>      Bach~ Bach~ NA     \n# i 31 more variables: fage <dbl>, mage <dbl>,\n#   total_kids <int>, interval <ord>,\n#   prenatal_start <ord>, prenatal_visits <dbl>,\n#   mheight <dbl>, wt_pre <dbl>,\n#   wt_delivery <dbl>, diabetes_pre <chr>,\n#   diabetes_gest <chr>, hbp_pre <chr>,\n#   hbp_gest <chr>, eclampsia <chr>, ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### *names* \n\nWe use this to find the names of the columns in a data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBirths2022 |> names()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"month\"           \"dow\"            \n [3] \"place\"           \"paternity\"      \n [5] \"meduc\"           \"feduc\"          \n [7] \"married\"         \"fage\"           \n [9] \"mage\"            \"total_kids\"     \n[11] \"interval\"        \"prenatal_start\" \n[13] \"prenatal_visits\" \"mheight\"        \n[15] \"wt_pre\"          \"wt_delivery\"    \n[17] \"diabetes_pre\"    \"diabetes_gest\"  \n[19] \"hbp_pre\"         \"hbp_gest\"       \n[21] \"eclampsia\"       \"induction\"      \n[23] \"augmentation\"    \"anesthesia\"     \n[25] \"presentation\"    \"method\"         \n[27] \"trial_at_labor\"  \"attendant\"      \n[29] \"payment\"         \"apgar5\"         \n[31] \"apgar10\"         \"plurality\"      \n[33] \"sex\"             \"duration\"       \n[35] \"menses\"          \"weight\"         \n[37] \"living\"          \"breastfed\"      \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### *summarize* {#sec-summarize-function}\n\nWe often calculate summaries (like the average of a variable) of the data contained in a data frame.  We will discuss other examples of summaries -- like variance, standard deviation, covariance, and correlation coefficient -- at appropriate points in the course.\n\nThe code below shows how to compute the average of the *time* variable in the *Boston_marathon* data frame. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBoston_marathon |> \n  summarize(avg_time = mean(time))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\n  avg_time \n  <drtn>   \n1 8635 secs\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the above code, we passed the Boston_marathon data frame via a pipe to the *summarize* function. Within the *summarize* function, we have used the R function *mean* to compute the average by passing the variable *time* as an argument to the *mean* function. \n\nWe chose to name the return value from the *mean* function (the average time) as *avg_time*. You do not necessarily need to name the summaries we compute in the *summarize* function, but we strongly recommend it.\n\nFor most of the summaries we compute we will use the general *summarize* function. WIthin the *summarize* function, we use specific functions depending on the kind of summary we are computing. In the previous example, we used the *mean* function for the average. Later we will see other functions to use within the *summarize* function.\n\n### *count* \n\nThe *count()* function comes in handy when we want to count how many occurrences of each distinct value in a column are present in a variable. For example, suppose we want to find how many rows are there for each sex we can do the following.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBoston_marathon |> count(sex)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 x 2\n  sex        n\n  <chr>  <int>\n1 female    50\n2 male     125\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSimilarly, if we wanted to find out how many times each country occurs, we can do this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBoston_marathon |> count(country)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 25 x 2\n   country               n\n   <chr>             <int>\n 1 Australia             1\n 2 Belgium               2\n 3 Canada               17\n 4 Colombia              1\n 5 Comm. Ind. States     1\n 6 England               3\n 7 Ethiopia             14\n 8 Finland               7\n 9 Germany               6\n10 Greece                2\n# i 15 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, the *count()* function comes in most handy when a variable is categorical. It also works for numerical variables, but will apply much more rarely in these cases.\n\n## Missing values (*NA*s)\n\nSuppose the HR department of a company has a data frame of information about employees with variables (columns) *employee_id*, *first_name*, *last_name*, *base_salary*, *phone_no*, and *base_office*. It is not essential that we have data on every variabkle for every row. For example, it could be the case that the company does not have a *phone_no* for some employees and does not have a *base_office* for some. These are called *missing values*. A missing value denotes somnething whose value *we do not know*. A missing value is not the same as a blank character value or a zero numeric value. Blanks and zero are valid and known values for variables. A *missing value is different* -- *we do not know the value*. \n\n@tbl-no-missing-values shows a data frame with no missing values. In each row, we see values for every variable.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-no-missing-values .cell tbl-cap='A data frame with no missing values -- in every row, every variable has a value'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|channel      | advertising_spend_k| weekly_sales_k|\n|:------------|-------------------:|--------------:|\n|Search Ads   |                28.1|            152|\n|Search Ads   |                30.6|            152|\n|Search Ads   |                93.4|            369|\n|Search Ads   |                51.3|            289|\n|Retail Promo |                54.6|            175|\n|Search Ads   |                86.6|            342|\n|Retail Promo |                46.5|            169|\n|Retail Promo |                41.4|            142|\n|Search Ads   |                78.1|            322|\n|Retail Promo |                41.1|            182|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOn the other hand @tbl-missing-values shows a small data frame with missing values.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-missing-values .cell tbl-cap='A data frame with missing values -- the *NA*s in columns *phone_no* and *base_office* represent missing values'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| employee_id|first_name |last_name | base_salary|phone_no          |base_office |\n|-----------:|:----------|:---------|-----------:|:-----------------|:-----------|\n|       10210|Betty      |Chu       |       67000|+1 (777) 555-1212 |New Jersey  |\n|       24532|Jason      |Fingleton |       85000|+1 (732) 555-1212 |NA          |\n|       56437|Shim       |Sung      |       76000|NA                |New York    |\n|       20320|Ravi       |Shankar   |      100000|+91 81487 03210   |Shankar     |\n|       67582|Emily      |Weitz     |       87000|NA                |Weitz       |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Codebook\n\nBefore using a data frame, we need to understand it well. That means, at the very least, that we know the unit of observation, the meaning of each variable and the units of measurement where applicable. This information is in the codebook for a data frame. You can use the ? operator for this purpose as the example code below shows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?Boston_marathon\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis will show the codebook in the bottom right pane of RStudio.",
