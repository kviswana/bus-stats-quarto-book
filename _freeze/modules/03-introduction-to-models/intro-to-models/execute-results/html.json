In one of the more common usages, a model is an approximate or simplified representation of something that is useful for some purpose.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nWhy does this chapter emphasize that a model is meant to be *useful* rather than *true*?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nBecause models deliberately leave things out. Their value comes from helping us make good decisions or gain insight, not from perfectly reproducing reality.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nWhy is leaving things out an essential feature of a model rather than a flaw?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nLeaving things out keeps the model manageable and focused. Including every detail would make the model as complex as reality itself and therefore not useful for understanding or decision-making.\n:::\n\n\n\n@fig-house and @fig-house-model show the image of a house and a miniature model of it. The miniature is a good representation of the house in some respects. For example, it depicts the overall shape and some exterior details quite accurately. If someone were about to build a new house and the architect showed them this model, they would get a good idea about the overall external appearance of the house and the color scheme as well. However, this model differs from the actual house in many ways as well -- one cannot actually step inside it! We cannot get a feel for how roomy the interior will feel. We do not know how the house will look in its actual surroundings. It is accurate in some respects and inaccurate in others.\n\n![Picture of a house](../../images/fig-house.png){#fig-house width=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![Model of the house in @fig-house](../../images/fig-house-model.png){#fig-house-model width=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nShould we consider the model in @fig-house-model good? In the words of statistician George E. P. Box, \"All models are wrong. But some are useful for certain purposes.\"\n\n\nAll models are wrong in the sense that they are only *representations*. However, as the miniature model of the house in @fig-house-model, they can still be useful for some purpose.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nAccording to this chapter, what does it mean for a model to be “wrong”?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nA model is “wrong” because it simplifies reality and ignores many factors. This is unavoidable and not a flaw—as long as the model is useful for the purpose at hand.\n:::\n\nWe will be building many models in this course and should remember the following:\n\n-   Models are simplifications: They inherently omit details and idealize reality to make complex systems manageable.\n-   Utility over accuracy: The goal isn't perfect truth, but practical application and insight for a specific goal, whether it's scientific, business, or everyday decision-making.\n-   Context matters: A model's usefulness depends on the purpose; a simple model might be great for a quick estimate, while a complex one is needed for detailed forecasting.\n-   Pragmatic approach: We should focus on how wrong a model can be and still be helpful, rather than getting stuck on its imperfections.\n\nHow to apply this philosophy:\n\n-   Question your models: Continuously ask how and where a model breaks down.\n-   Understand its limitations: Know the assumptions and simplifications behind the model.\n-   Adapt and evolve: Be willing to refine or discard models as new information emerges or situations change.\n\n## Mathematical models\n\nIn this course, we will be building a specific kind of models -- *statistical models*. However, before getting to *statistical* models, we will consider some simpler *mathematical models*. The term *mathematical model* can connote many different things. Let us clarify the sense in which we use the term. Suppose I have a data frame *homes* with data about many homes. For each home, we have its *age*, *floor-area_sqft*, *number_of_bedrooms*, *number_of_bathrooms*, and *price*. Here are the initial rows in the data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhomes |> \n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"age\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"floor_area_sqft\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"number_of_bedrooms\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"no_of_bathrooms\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"price\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"20\",\"2\":\"1901\",\"3\":\"4\",\"4\":\"3\",\"5\":\"915000\"},{\"1\":\"55\",\"2\":\"1614\",\"3\":\"3\",\"4\":\"3\",\"5\":\"710000\"},{\"1\":\"29\",\"2\":\"1738\",\"3\":\"3\",\"4\":\"2\",\"5\":\"708000\"},{\"1\":\"62\",\"2\":\"2137\",\"3\":\"4\",\"4\":\"3\",\"5\":\"849000\"},{\"1\":\"66\",\"2\":\"1480\",\"3\":\"3\",\"4\":\"2\",\"5\":\"553000\"},{\"1\":\"3\",\"2\":\"2492\",\"3\":\"5\",\"4\":\"4\",\"5\":\"1068000\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe might build a model to determine the value of *price* given the values of one or more of the other variables. In this case, let us use the variable *floor_area_sqft*. Remember, this is a model and so we do not expect it be be exact. We do not aim for the model to determine the actual *price*, but only to compute a good *estimate* of the *price* that works well on average across many repetitions. (We have obviously simplified the situation for pedagogical purposes. House prices depend on many other factors. But that need not hold us back. You will still learn the underlying concepts.). \n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nWhy does making a decision under uncertainty require thinking about *many possible outcomes*, not just one?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nBecause the decision must be chosen *before* knowing which outcome will occur. A good decision performs reasonably well across all plausible outcomes, not just a single case.\n:::\n\n\nWhat might the model look like? @eq-price-model shows the model. *For now, do not worry about how we arrived the model.*\n\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{price}} = 61{,}399 + 394\\,\\text{floor\\_area\\_sqft}\n$$ {#eq-price-model}\n\nIn the model, we have placed a *hat* over *price* because the model computes not the actual price of a home with the specified floor area and instead only computes an estimate. In statistics, we place a *hat* over quantities that estimate other quantities.\n\n\n@eq-price-model shows a *linear* model. We call it *linear* because all variables are only raised to the fist power. We have not squared or raised a variable to any other power. In this course we build only *linear models*.\n\nWe call the equation that @eq-price-model shows a **model function**. \n\nOnce we have a model function, we can compute model estimates for given inputs. For example, @eq-price-model says that the estimated price for a home with 1000 sq-ft is: \n\n61,399 + 394*1,000 = 455,399\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nIf I have a model (don't take this model seriously) for computing an estimated value for a person's height based on their weight as: estimated height (in cm) = 120 plus 0.6 times the weight (in kg). Write out the model function as an equation.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Height (cm)}} = 120 + 0.6 \\, \\text{Weight (kg)}\n$$\n:::\n\nIn our context, we use the term *model* to denote a mathematical equation of the kind that @eq-price-model shows. Our models help us to determine the value of a variable in a data frame for any given instance. Specifically, in the house price example that we just considered, the model in @eq-price-model enables us to estimate the *price* of a home, given its floor area.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nUsing the same model equation to link the height of a person to their weight:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Height (cm)}} = 120 + 0.6 \\, \\text{Weight (kg)}\n$$\n\nWhat is the estimated weight of a person who weighs 70 kgs?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\n120 + 0.6*70 = 162 cm\n:::\n\n\n### *Response* and *Explanatory* variables\n\nWe call the variable whose value the model estimates the *response* variable. The variables based on which the model estimates the *response* variable are called *explanatory* variables. We can also refer to the *response* variable as the *dependent* variable, and *explanatory* variables as *independent* variables.\n\nIn this course we use the terms *response variable* and *explanatory variables*. @tbl-response-explanatory-other-names shows several other terms for these used in different disciplines or application areas.\n\n| **Response Variable** | **Explanatory Variable** | **Common Usage / Context** |\n|:----------------------|:-------------------------|:---------------------------|\n| Dependent variable    | Independent variable     | Traditional statistics and regression terminology |\n| Outcome variable      | Predictor variable       | Applied statistics, social sciences, medical studies |\n| Target variable       | Input variable           | Machine learning and predictive modeling |\n| Output variable       | Feature                  | Data science and ML pipelines |\n| Y variable            | X variable               | Algebraic and mathematical notation |\n| Response              | Covariate                | Regression modeling and econometrics |\n| Effect                | Regressor                | Causal modeling and econometric contexts |\n\n: Other commonly used names for *response* and *explanatory* variables in various areas {#tbl-response-explanatory-other-names}\n\n\n### Using the model\n\nThe house in the fifth row of the data frame has floor area of 1480. Its actual price is \\$553,000. What price does the model estimate? Well, we can plug the floor area into the model -- @eq-price-model -- and find out. If we plug it in, we get \\$645,999. The model overestimates this price.\n\nThe house in the fourteenth row of the data frame has floor area of 1293 Its actual price is \\$561,000. What price does the model estimate? Well, we can plug the floor area into the model -- @eq-price-model -- and find out. If we plug it in, we get \\$572,134. Quite close.\n\nYou should try out some more cases and wee how the model does. We will learn a lot more about such models, including precisely measuring their *quality* as we go forward.\n\nI won't blame you if you are wondering \"We already have the prices in the data frame. Why do we need a model to calculate these?\"\n\nConsider again the home in the fifth row. Why did the model overestimate the price? Well, you should consider that this particular home was not the only one whose floor area was in the vicinity of 1480. The data set has other homes with similar floor areas and their prices vary. If we look at homes that have floor areas between 1430 and 1530, we see that their prices range from \\$553,000 to \\$647,000. Our model makes an estimate based on the whole data frame. In fact, many homes below 1480 square feet in floor area have higher prices. How could that be? Well, variables other than floor area play a role in price too. We should not make the mistake of thinking that our models have all the necessary information. Recall that a model is a simplification for a specific purpose.\n\nThe next section addresses two main uses of models.\n\n## Purpose of a model\n\nWe use models in two main ways:\n\n1.  *Prediction*: Suppose we have built a model using the data in a data frame to estimate the *price* of a home, given its *floor_area_sqft*. We can potentially use this model to estimate the price of any home whose floor area we know and whose price we do not know -- even if this home is not in the data set.\n2.  *Explanation*: Our model in @eq-price-model tells us that the price of a home is related to its floor area. This makes sense and we could have said this even without a model. However, when people gather data about phenomena that they do not fully understand, and want to understand, they often build models to understand and explain which variables seem to be related and in what way to a variable of interest.\n\nSo, for our purposes in this course, we can define the term *model* as:\n\n> A model is a simple story we tell about data to help us summarize, explain, or predict.\n\nYou might have noted that both of the above purposes actually require us to use a model in contexts that go outside the data that we based the model on. When we start using models outside of the data we used to build the model, we come face to face with the essence of statistics. We will get to that later in the course.\n\n## Average is a model too!\n\nIn @eq-price-model, we had a *response* variable and an *explanatory* variable. What if we do not have any explanatory variable? In the context of our home prices example, not having an *explanatory* variable is equivalent to saying:\n\n-   \"I have a data set of 100 homes\"\n-   \"Here are their prices\"\n-   \"I am not telling you anything else about these homes\"\n-   \"I have selected a random home from my data set\"\n-   \"Guess the price of the home I have in mind\"\n\nBased on the game we played in @sec-mean-model, you first compute the average of the prices as \\$733,440. Your best *model* to make your guess is:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{price}} = 733{,}440\n$$ {#eq-avg-price-model}\n\nThat is, like in the game we played, no matter which home I choose, you always state the average as your guess. @eq-avg-price-model shows the *model function* when we have no \n\nThe big difference between the models in @eq-price-model and @eq-avg-price-model is that the second one *has no explanatory variable*. When we are not given any additional helpful information to estimate a value, our best estimate -- *best model* -- is the average!\n",
