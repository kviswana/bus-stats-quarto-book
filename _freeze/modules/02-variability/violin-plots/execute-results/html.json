We have used the\nterm to refer to a column of a data frame. We explained the rationale\nfor the name from the fact that the values in a single column of a data\nframe *vary*. That is, not all the rows of a column have the same value.\nFor example, we see in @tbl-boston-marathon-2 that the values in the\ncolumn *minutes* vary -- that is, not all the values in the column are\nthe same. The same is true of every column.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-boston-marathon-2 .cell tbl-cap='Boston Marathon data (20 randonmly selected rows).'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| year|name                      |country       |time     |sex    | minutes|\n|----:|:-------------------------|:-------------|:--------|:------|-------:|\n| 1994|Cosmas Ndeti              |Kenya         |02:07:15 |male   |     127|\n| 1975|Liane Winter              |Germany       |02:42:24 |female |     162|\n| 1973|Jon Anderson              |United States |02:16:03 |male   |     136|\n| 1949|Karl Gosta Leandersson    |Sweden        |02:31:50 |male   |     152|\n| 1988|Rosa Mota                 |Portugal      |02:24:30 |female |     144|\n| 2002|Margaret Okayo            |Kenya         |02:20:43 |female |     141|\n| 1981|Toshihiko Seko            |Japan         |02:09:26 |male   |     129|\n| 1921|Frank T.

Values can repeat. However we have variety in a\ncolumn as long as all the values are not the same. Very rarely will you\ncome across data frames in which all the values of a column are the\nsame. In this case the column does not serve any useful purpose for data\nanalysis.\n\nIn this course, we deal only with variability in numerical variables.\nStatistics deals with variability in categorical variables as well, but\nthis book does not consider this in any depth.\n\n## Distribution\n\nConsider a variable with maximum value of 200 and minimum value 10. Let us suppose that we have 500 values for this variable (500 rows in the data frame). This means that the 500 values are all in the range 10 to 200. \n\nWe are interested in knowing how these 500 numbers are *distributed* across the range of 10 to 200. \n\n- It could be the case that the 500 numbers are more or less uniformly distributed over their range with approximately the same number of occurrences throughout the range.  \n- It could also be the case that the numbers are mostly concentrated in the middle -- near 105 or so and as we go further away in either direction, the concentration of numbers drops off. \n- Or the numbers could be crowded near, the lower extreme, sat at around 50 or so and be much more sparse away from this point.\n- Or it could be that there is heavy concentration around 50 and 150 and less elsewhere.\n\nThe pattern of concentration of values of a variable across its entire range is called the **distribution** of the variable.\n\n\nIn this chapter we focus on visualization alone. The next chapter goes into measuring variation precisely. \n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nIn your own words, what does it mean to say a variable has a distribution?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nA distribution describes how often different values of a variable occur and how those values are spread out across their range.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nWhy is it misleading to describe a data set using only a single number like the mean?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nBecause very different data sets can share the same mean while having different spreads, shapes, or extreme values.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nHow does a distribution answer the question: “What values are typical?”\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nIt shows where values cluster most densely and which values occur rarely.\n:::\n\n### Uniform distribution\n\nSuppose we have 1000 numbers with each one being an integer between 1\nand 100. Some of the numbers in this data might be 45, 23, 46, 89, 1,\n23, 45, 56, and so on. If each number occurs exactly 10 times -- that is\nwe have 10 ones, 10 twos and so on up to 10 hundreds, we have what is\ncalled as the *uniform distribution*. In a uniform distribution, each\nnumber in the range of the list occurs the same number of times.\n\n@fig-perfect-uniform-hist shows a *histogram* of a set of numbers. A\n*histogram* breaks up the whole range of the data points into *bins*. In\nour example, the numbers range from 1 to 100. A histogram might break\nthis up into some number of *bins*. If the number of bins is 10, then\nthe numbers between 1 and 10 will fall unto 1 bin. The numbers between\n11 and 20 into the next bin and so on. In this example, the bin-width is\n10 because each bin spans a range of size 10. The x-axis of the\nhistogram shows the number values and a bar for each bin. The y axis\nshows how many of the numbers fall into each bin and so the pattern\nformed by the heights of the bars helps us to see the *distribution* of\nthe numbers.\n\n@fig-perfect-uniform-hist shows numbers that are perfectly uniformly\ndistributed. We have used a bin-width of 1 to have each individual\ninteger fall into its own bin. In a *uniform distribution* every number\nin the overall range of the numbers occurs exactly the same number of\ntimes.\n\n![Perfect uniform distribution -- each number between 1 and 100 occurs\nthe same number of times (10 times), as you can see from the height of\nthe\nbars](../../images/fig-perfect-uniform-hist.png){#fig-perfect-uniform-hist\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nOur current example deals with integers, but in general when we have\nnumerical variables, we will deal with numbers that also have a\nfractional part. Histograms work in the same way for those too, except\nthat we cannot have one bin for each distinct value as there is\npotentially an infinite number of values in any range.\n\n@fig-approx-uniform-hist shows an example of a set of numbers\ndistributed approximately uniformly. For example, Each number does not\noccur exactly the same number of times, but they are loosely similar.\nFor example, the number 2 seems to appear around 13 times and the number\n25 seems to occur around 18 times. In practice, uniformly distributed\nnumbers will look more like @fig-approx-uniform-hist than\n@fig-perfect-uniform-hist.\n\n![Approximate uniform distribution -- each number between 1 and 100\noccurs more or less the same number of\ntimes](../../images/fig-approx-uniform-hist.png){#fig-approx-uniform-hist\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nA numerical variable does not necessarily have to be distributed\nuniformly. That is each number in the range does not have to occur an\nequal number of times exactly or approximately. We will now look at some\nother common possibilities.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nWould you expect to find truly uniform distributions in real business data??\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\nNo. Most business processes involve constraints, preferences, or natural variation that cause some values to occur more often than others.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nGive one business example where a roughly uniform distribution might appear.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nRandomly assigned identification numbers (like school student ids) or lottery numbers.\n:::\n\n### Bell shaped distributions\n\n@fig-normal-low-sd-hist and @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist show two *bell\nshaped* distributions. Both have their peaks around the middle of the\nrange between 1 and 100. Which means that numbers closer to the middle\n-- or closer to 50 -- occur more frequently than those far away from 50.\n\n![Symmetric bell shaped distribution with a peak at around\n50](../../images/fig-normal-low-sd-hist.png){#fig-normal-low-sd-hist\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![Symmetric bell shaped distribution with a peak at around 50 and higher\nspread than in\n@fig-normal-low-sd-hist](../../images/fig-normal-higher-sd-hist.png){#fig-normal-higher-sd-hist\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nBoth @fig-normal-low-sd-hist and @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist show bell\nshaped distributions that are also symmetric. That is, the shape to the\nleft of the peak is approximately similar to the shape on the right.\n\nSo, both of these are bell shaped and symmetric, and yet they are\nobviously different? Can you describe how they are different?\n\nWe see that the spread\\* of the numbers is quite different. In\n@fig-normal-low-sd-hist the numbers are more concentrated near the\nmiddle than is the case in @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist. Consequently, the\npeak in the first figure is higher. For example, the numbers 47 and 51\noccur nearly 50 times. In @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist, the highest\nfrequency is around 35. We call the ends of the bell shape as *tails*. We\nsee that @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist has *fatter* tails.\n\nWe have seen three different possibilities for how a set of 1000 numbers\nin the range 1 to 100 can be distributed. Even though the averages of a\nset of numbers and even their range might be the same they can still be\n*distributed* very differently.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Multi-modal distributions\n\nIn @fig-normal-low-sd-hist and @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist we saw\ndistributions that each had a single peak. This does not have to be the\ncase. shows a case where we have two peaks.\n\n![Distribution with more than one peak -- multi-modal\ndistribution](../../images/fig-bimodal-hist.png){#fig-bimodal-hist\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n\n### Skewed distributions\n\nThus far, we have seen distributions in which the shape has always been\nsymmetric -- explicitly so in the bell-shaped examples, but also true for\nthe *uniform* examples. @fig-right-skew-hist and @fig-left-skew-hist\nshow examples of asymmetric distributions. The first has a long *tail*\non the right and is said to be *right-skewed* and the second has its\n*tail* on the left and is said to be *left-skewed*.\n\n![Asymmetric distribution with a right\nskew](../../images/fig-right-skew-hist.png){#fig-right-skew-hist\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![Asymmetric distribution with a left\nskew](../../images/fig-left-skew-hist.png){#fig-left-skew-hist\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Violin plots\n\nNow that we have clarified the idea of a *distribution* let us look at\ndistributions of numerical variables through *violin* plots. These plots\nserve the same function as the histograms we have looked at in the\nprevious section, but we can do more. \n\n>A violin plot is not a new idea. It is a different lens on the same distribution concepts you already saw in the previous section.\n\nLet us start off by looking at a violin plot of the variable *minutes* from the *Boston_marathon* data frame\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBoston_marathon |> \n  point_plot(minutes ~ 1, annot = \"violin\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin plot of the *minutes* variable from the *Boston_marathon* data frame](violin-plots_files/figure-html/fig-boston-marathon-minutes-violin-1.png){#fig-boston-marathon-minutes-violin width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe width of the violin at any point on the y-axis shows the **relative\nfrequency** of data values close to that point. The widest part of the\nviolin occurs at around 145 minutes. This means that the maximum\nconcentration of winning times in the data set is close to 145 minutes.\nThe plot does not tell us exactly what the frequency is. The width only\nshows the relative frequency. Looking at where the violin is very\nnarrow, we can say that very few runners took more than 175 minutes to\ncomplete the race. Also, relatively low numbers of people took less than\nabout 125 minutes. We can see a higher density of points around the\nbroad regions of the violin and a low density in the narrow areas of the\nviolin.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Important:\nThe width of a violin **does not represent the number of observations at an exact value**. It represents a **smoothed estimate** of how densely values occur near that value as compared to the density of values near other values.\n:::\n\n\n### Elements of the plot\n\nUntil now, the plots we have generated using *point plot* have only\nshown the actual points. However, in @fig-boston-marathon-minutes-violin\nwe see two distinct elements:\n\n-   a jittered plot of the individual points\n-   a violin-shaped solid area -- an *annotation* encompassing the\n    points themselves\n\nThe points represent the raw data and the violin adds an *annotation*\nthat interprets the data in some way. Here, the interpretation is a\nviolin plot that helps us visualize the distribution of the values.\n\n### Examining the code\n\nWe examine the code now. In the code for\n@fig-boston-marathon-minutes-violin, we can see two arguments for the\n*point_plot* function. The first argument specifies the tilde expression\nmapping the axes. The second specifies the type of *annotation* we want.\n@fig-boston-marathon-minutes-violin-code-dissect shows the code with the\ntwo arguments labeled.\n\n![The code to generate @fig-boston-marathon-minutes-violin passes two\narguments to the *point_plot* function -- a tilde expression and an\n*annotation*\nspecification](../../images/fig-boston-marathon-minutes-violin-code-dissect.png){#fig-boston-marathon-minutes-violin-code-dissect\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n@fig-tilde-expression-violin-boston-marathon explains the tilde\nexpression used for the plot. Mapping of *minutes* to the y-axis\nconforms to what we did before. This plot deals with just a single\nvariable -- we have no variable on the x-axis. When there is no variable\non the x-axis, we conventionally that by just using \"1\" for the x-axis\nvariable.\n\n![The tilde expression of\n@fig-boston-marathon-minutes-violin-code-dissect we place *minutes* on\nthe y-axis and since the x-axis has no variable, we just state\n\"1\"](../../images/fig-tilde-expression-violin-boston-marathon.png){#fig-tilde-expression-violin-boston-marathon\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n@fig-annot-violin-argument explains the second argument in generating a\n*violin plot*.\n\n![We specify that we want a *violin\nannotation*](../../images/fig-annot-violin-argument.png){#fig-annot-violin-argument\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Violin plots and distribution shapes\n\nThe violin plot displays vertical reflectional symmetry. We can get all\nthe information that the plot conveys just by slicing the plot\nvertically down the middle and looking at either of the two chunks.\n\nWhen we first talked about the various distribution shapes like\n*uniform*, *symmetric bell-shaped*, and *skewed*, we used histograms to\nconvey the ideas. We can deduce the same information from violin plots\nas well. In the next section, we will see a few more examples. We will\ndiscuss distribution shapes in the context of those examples.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## What to look for in a violin plot\n\n- Where are most values concentrated?\n- Are there one or multiple peaks?\n- Is the distribution symmetric or skewed?\n- Are there long tails or unusual shapes?\n:::\n\n### More examples\n\nWe see a few more examples to reinforce the idea.\n@fig-price-violin-from-price-demand-dataframe shows a violin plot of the\nvariable *price* from the *price_demand* data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprice_demand |> \n  point_plot(price ~ 1, annot = \"violin\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin plot of the *price* variable from the *price_demand* data frame](violin-plots_files/figure-html/fig-price-violin-from-price-demand-dataframe-1.png){#fig-price-violin-from-price-demand-dataframe width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we look at only the left or right half of\n@fig-price-violin-from-price-demand-dataframe, turn it right by 90\ndegrees and get rid of the display of the individual points, we get\n@fig-sliced-rotated-violin -- a symmetric bell-shaped distribution.\n\n![Violin from @fig-price-violin-from-price-demand-dataframe split and\nrotated 90 degrees right to reveal the distribution in the form we had\nseen\nbefore](../../images/fig-sliced-rotated-violin.png){#fig-sliced-rotated-violin\nwidth=\"70%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n@fig-balance-violin-from-acct-type-balance-dataframe shows a violin plot\nof the *balance* variable from the *acct_type_balance* data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacct_type_balance |> \n  point_plot(balance ~ 1, annot = \"violin\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin plot of the *balance* variable from the *acct_type_balance* data frame](violin-plots_files/figure-html/fig-balance-violin-from-acct-type-balance-dataframe-1.png){#fig-balance-violin-from-acct-type-balance-dataframe width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see from @fig-price-violin-from-price-demand-dataframe that\n*price* is bell-shaped and unimodal,but not symmetric. It is skewed\ntowards the lower values because the tail is at the bottom. If we slice\nand rotate it as before then we would say that it is skewed left.\n\nNext we look at the distribution of *advertising_spend_k* from the\n*advertising_sales_channel* data frame.\n@fig-advertising-spend-violin-from-advertising-sales-channel-dataframe\nshows the violin plot. From it we see that *advertising_spend_k* follows\na nearly uniform distribution, but not perfectly so. It is mildly\nbi modal.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadvertising_sales_channel |> \n  point_plot(advertising_spend_k ~ 1, annot = \"violin\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin plot of the *advertising_spend_k* variable from the *advertising_sales_channel* data frame](violin-plots_files/figure-html/fig-advertising-spend-violin-from-advertising-sales-channel-dataframe-1.png){#fig-advertising-spend-violin-from-advertising-sales-channel-dataframe width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nWhere would the violin be widest for a symmetric bell-shaped distribution?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nNear the center, where values occur most frequently.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nIf you have a symmetric bell-shaped violin plot what does it say about values on the high and low ends of the range? \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nExtreme high and low values occur with similar rarity.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nWould you generally expect bell-shaped distributions in measurement based data?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nYes. Take people's heights for instance. They will tend to be bell shaped with the maximum density around the average height. Because many small, independent influences combine to produce values near an average. This is actually a very important theorem in Statistics and is called the *Central Limit Theorem*. We will not be studying it in this course. This is not to say that most real-life data tend to be symmetric bell-shaped. For instance, incomes tend to be skewed towards higher values (or to the right). A few common distributions capture a surprisingly large number of real-world phenomena.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nDescribe how mulch-modal distributions look on a violin plot.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nAs multiple bulges or wide regions separated by narrower sections.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nWhat might cause a business data set to have more than one mode?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nThe data may combine different subgroups, such as entry-level and senior employees.

A small number of extreme values can pull the mean away from where most observations lie.\n:::\n\n## Comparing distributions with violin plots\n\nThus far, we have examined distributions of individual variables in\nisolation. In statistics we often want to compare distributions. For\nexample, in the *acct_type_balance* data frame, how does the\ndistribution of *balance* for *Checking* accounts compare with that for\n*Savings* accounts?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacct_type_balance |> \n  point_plot(balance ~ bank_account_type, annot = \"violin\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin plots of the *balance* variable for different accoiunt types -- from the *price_demand* data frame](violin-plots_files/figure-html/fig-comparative-balance-violin-from-acct-type-balance-dataframe-1.png){#fig-comparative-balance-violin-from-acct-type-balance-dataframe width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSince we want to compare the two violins corresponding to the two\ndifferent account types, we now have *bank_account_type* on the x-axis\nand our tilde expression reflects this.\n\n@fig-comparative-balance-violin-from-acct-type-balance-dataframe shows\nseveral things: - account balances in *Savings* accounts are generally\nlarger - account balances of *Savings* accounts are distributed in an\nalmost symmetrical bell shape with the maximum density around \\$6,000. -\naccount balances of *Checking* accounts are generally smaller than those\nof *Savings* accounts - account balances of *Checking* accounts are bell\nshaped, but skewed towards lower values with the maximum density around\n\\$5,400 or so.\n\n-   As another example of comparing distributions, let us use the\n    *advertising_sales_channel* data frame to compare the distribution\n    of *weekly_sales_k* for different *channel*s .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadvertising_sales_channel |> \n  point_plot(weekly_sales_k ~ channel, annot = \"violin\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin plots of the *weekly_sales_k* variable for different sales channels -- from the *advertising_sales_channel* data frame](violin-plots_files/figure-html/fig-comparative-weekly-spend-violin-from-advertising-sales-channel-data-frame-1.png){#fig-comparative-weekly-spend-violin-from-advertising-sales-channel-data-frame width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-comparative-weekly-spend-violin-from-advertising-sales-channel-data-frame\ntells us the following: - *weekly_sales_k* values are generally lower\nfor the *Retail Promo* channel - for the *Retail Promo* channel\n*weekly_sales_k* is distributed systematically with three short peaks -\n*weekly_sales_k* values are almost uniformly distributed for the *Search\nAds* channel and have a much larger range than the *Retail Sales*\nchannel\n\n\n",
