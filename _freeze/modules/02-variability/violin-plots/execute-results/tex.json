We  explained the rationale for the name from the fact that the values in a single column of a data frame *vary*. That is, not all the rows of a column have the same value. For example, we see in @tbl-boston-marathon-2 that the values in the column *minutes* vary -- that is, not all the values in the column are the same. The same is true of every column. \n\n\n::: {#tbl-boston-marathon-2 .cell tbl-cap='Boston Marathon data (20 randonmly selected rows).'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| year|name                  |country       |time     |sex    | minutes|\n|----:|:---------------------|:-------------|:--------|:------|-------:|\n| 2017|Edna Kiplagat         |Kenya         |02:21:52 |female |     142|\n| 2019|Lawrence Cherono      |Kenya         |02:07:57 |male   |     128|\n| 1897|John J.

Values can repeat. However we have variety in a column as long as all the values are not the same. Very rarely will you come across data frames in which all the values of a column are the same. In this case the column does not serve any useful purpose for data analysis.\n\nIn this course, we deal only with variability in numerical variables. Statistics deals with variability in categorical variables as well, but this book does not consider this in any depth.\n\n## Distribution\n\nBefore we look at the distribution of variables in a data frame, let us look at variability in sets of numbers to understand the idea of *distribution*. In this chapter we focus on visualization alone. The next chapter goes into measuring variation precisely.\n\n### Uniform distribution\n\nSuppose we have 1000 numbers with each one being an integer between 1 and 100. Some of the numbers in this data might be 45, 23, 46, 89, 1, 23, 45, 56, and so on. If each number occurs exactly 10 times -- that is we have 10 ones, 10 twos and so on up to 10 hundreds, we have what is called as the *uniform distrigution*. In a uniform distribution, each number in the range of the list occurs the same number of times. \n\n@fig-perfect-uniform-hist shows a *histogram* of a set of numbers. A *histogram* breaks up the whole range of the data points into *bins*. In our example, the numbers range from 1 to 100. A histogram might break this up into some number of *bins*. If the number of bins is 10, then the numbers between 1 and 10 will fall unto 1 bin. The numbers between 11 and 20 into the next bin and so on. In this example, the bin-width is 10 because each bin spans a range of size 10. The x-axis of the histogram shows the number values and a bar for each bin. The y axis shows how many of the numbers fall into each bin and so the pattern formed by the heights of the bars helps us to see the *distribution* of the numbers.\n\n@fig-perfect-uniform-hist shows numbers that are perfectly uniformly distributed. We have used a bin-width of 1 to have each individual integer fall into its own bin. In a *uniform distribution* every number in the overall range of the numbers occurs exactly the same number of times. \n\n![Perfect uniform distribution -- each number between 1 and 100 occurs the same number of times (10 times), as you can see from the height of the bars](../../images/fig-perfect-uniform-hist.png){#fig-perfect-uniform-hist width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nOur current example deals with integers, but in general when we have numerical variables, we will deal with numbers that also have a fractional part. Histograms work in the same way for those too, except that we cannot have one bin for each distinct value as there is potentially an inficite number of values in any range.\n\n@fig-approx-uniform-hist shows an example of a set of numbers distributed approximately uniformly. For example, Each number does not occur exactly the same number of times, but they are loosely similar. For example, the number 2 seems to appear around 13 times and the number 25 seems to occur around 18 times. In practice, uniformly distributed numbers will look more like @fig-approx-uniform-hist than @fig-perfect-uniform-hist.\n\n\n![Approximate uniform distribution -- each number between 1 and 100 occurs more or less the same number of times](../../images/fig-approx-uniform-hist.png){#fig-approx-uniform-hist width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nA numerical variable does not necessarily have to be distributed uniformly. That is each number in the range does not have to occur an equal number of times exactly or approximately. We will now look at some other commmon possibilities.\n\n\n### Bell shaped distributions\n\n@fig-normal-low-sd-hist and @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist show two *bell shaped* distributions. Both have their peaks around the middle of the range between 1 and 100. Which means that numbers closer to the middle -- or closer to 50 -- occur more frequently than those far away from 50.\n\n![Symmetric bell shaped distribution with a peak at around 50](../../images/fig-normal-low-sd-hist.png){#fig-normal-low-sd-hist width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n\n\n![Symmetric bell shaped distribution with a peak at around 50 and higher spread than in @fig-normal-low-sd-hist](../../images/fig-normal-higher-sd-hist.png){#fig-normal-higher-sd-hist width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\nBoth @fig-normal-low-sd-hist and @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist show bell shaped distributions that are also symmetric. That is, the shape to the left of the peak is approximately similar to the shape on the right.\n\nSo, both of these are bell shaped and symmetric, and yet they are obviously different? Can you describe how they are different?\n\nWe see that the spread* of the numbers is quite different. In @fig-normal-low-sd-hist the numbers are more concentrated near the middle than is the case in @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist. Consequently, the peak in the first figure is higher. For example, the numbers 47 and 51 occur nearly 50 times. In @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist, the higest frequency is around 35. We call the ends of the bell shae as *tails*. We see that @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist has *fatter* tails.\n\n\nWe have seen three different possibilities for how a set of 1000 numbers in the range 1 to 100 can be distributed. Even though the averages of a set of numbers and even their range might be the same they can still be *distributed* very differently.\n\n### Multi-modal distributions\n\nIn @fig-normal-low-sd-hist and @fig-normal-higher-sd-hist we saw distributions that each had a single peak. This does not have to be the case. shows a case where we have two peaks.\n\n![Distribution with more than one peak -- multi-modal distribution](../../images/fig-bimodal-hist.png){#fig-bimodal-hist width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n\n### Skewed distributions\n\nThus far, we have seen distributions in which the shape has always been symmetric -- explicitly so in the bell-shaped examples, but also tru for the *uniform* examples. @fig-right-skew-hist and @fig-left-skew-hist show examples of asymmetric distributions. The first has a long *tail* on the right and is said to be *right-skewed* and the second has its *tail* on the left and is said to be *left-skewed*.\n\n![Asymmetric distribution with a right skew](../../images/fig-right-skew-hist.png){#fig-right-skew-hist width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n![Asymmetric distribution with a left skew](../../images/fig-left-skew-hist.png){#fig-left-skew-hist width=70% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
