Why? Let us make things more concrete. A data frame with data on employees of a company might have a column named \"salary\" to store the salaries of employees. Salaries of employees vary. That is, we know that not everyone in the company has the same salary (generally speaking). So, it makes eminent sense to call a column a \"variable.\"\n\nSimilarly, the same data frame might have another column named \"Position\" that stores the position of each employee. Some example values might be \"Manager\", \"Sales associate\", and \"IT Specialist.\" Here too we see \"variability\" because not all the values in the column are the same. So the term \"variable\" applies to columns whether they contain numeric or categorical values. However, for the rest of this document, we concern ourselves only with numerical variables.\n\n## Why *means* (averages) are not enough\n\nIn business, averages are often the first numbers we look at. Average revenue, average delivery time, average customer wait time, average return on investment—these figures are easy to compute and easy to communicate.\n\nBut averages alone can be dangerously misleading.\n\nTo see why, consider the following examples.\n\n### Example 1: Two stores, same average sales\n\nSuppose two retail stores each reports **average daily sales of \\$10,000**.\n\n-   **Store A** has daily sales that are usually between \\$9,500 and \\$10,500.\n-   **Store B** has daily sales that swing wildly, ranging from \\$3,000 on slow days to \\$25,000 on busy days.\n\nFrom the average alone, the two stores appear identical. From a management perspective, they are not.\n\nStore A is predictable. Staffing, inventory, and cash flow planning are relatively straightforward. Store B is risky. Some days it is overstaffed and overstocked; on other days it cannot meet demand.\n\nThe average hides this difference. What distinguishes the two stores is **variability**, not the mean.\n\n### Example 2: Average delivery time\n\nA logistics manager is choosing between two suppliers. Both advertise an **average delivery time of 5 days**.\n\n-   Supplier X delivers in 4–6 days almost every time.\n-   Supplier Y sometimes delivers in 2 days and sometimes in 12 days.\n\nIf you only look at averages, the suppliers appear almost equivalent.\n\nIf your business depends on reliable delivery schedules, they are not.\n\nIn this context, variability directly affects:\n\n-   Production planning\n-   Inventory holding costs\n-   Customer satisfaction\n\nOnce again, the average tells only part of the story.\n\n### Example 3: Investment Returns\n\nTwo investment portfolios have the same **average annual return of 8%**.\n\n-   Portfolio A produces returns close to 8% year after year.\n-   Portfolio B alternates between very high gains and significant losses.\n\nMany investors would consider Portfolio B riskier, even though the averages are identical. That perception of risk comes from **how spread out the returns are**, not from the mean itself.\n\n### The Key Idea\n\nAverages describe the *center* of the data, but they say nothing about how the data are **spread out**.\n\nIn business settings, variability affects:\n\n-   Risk\n-   Reliability\n-   Predictability\n-   Planning and decision-making\n\nTo fully understand a data set, we need measures that describe **how much values differ from the average**. That is the role of **variance** and **standard deviation**.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nTwo companies have the same average monthly revenue. Company A’s revenue is very stable from month to month, while Company B’s revenue fluctuates widely. Why might a manager prefer Company A, even though the averages are the same?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nA manager might prefer Company A because its stable revenue makes planning easier and reduces risk. Predictable revenue helps with budgeting, staffing, inventory management, and cash flow. Company B’s wide fluctuations introduce uncertainty, even though its average revenue is the same.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nTwo suppliers both report an average delivery time of five days. One supplier delivers in a narrow range of times, while the other sometimes delivers very early and sometimes very late. What important information does the average delivery time fail to capture?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nThe average delivery time does not capture how consistent or reliable deliveries are. It ignores variability. A supplier with unpredictable delivery times can disrupt production schedules and increase costs, even if the average delivery time is acceptable.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nExplain why averages alone are insufficient for assessing risk in investment decisions.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nAverages do not show how much returns vary from year to year. Two investments can have the same average return but very different levels of risk. Higher variability in returns generally means greater uncertainty and risk for the investor.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nIn your own words, explain what variability means in a business context.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nVariability refers to how much outcomes differ from their average value. In business, it reflects unpredictability in areas such as sales, delivery times, costs, or returns, which can affect planning and decision-making.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Quick Check {.unnumbered}\n\nGive one example of a business decision where variability might matter more than the average.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Suggested answer {.unnumbered}\n\nExamples include delivery times in a supply chain, customer wait times in a service operation, investment returns, manufacturing defect rates, or daily demand for a product. In these cases, high variability can cause operational problems even if the average appears acceptable.\n:::\n\nIn the sections that follow, we will develop these measures and learn how to interpret them in practical business contexts.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Grasp this\n\nVariance and standard deviation quantify how much data values typically deviate from the mean.\n:::\n\n## Amount of Variation\n\nMeasuring the amount of variation plays an important role in statistics. If a column has no variation, then we cannot make much use of the information in the column. When a column does have variation, we often want to know the extent of variation in the values of the column. We want to ascribe a specific number -- that is, *measure* the variation in a column. We call this measure the *variance* of the values in a column. When the numbers in a column are all the same, then we say that the column has no variance -- that is, the variance is zero.\n\nConsider the following three sets of 8 numbers each:\n- Set 1: (1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1)\n- Set 2: (2, 6, 8, 2, 9, 2, 10, 9)\n- Set 3: (1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4)\n\nWhich of the three sets has the highest amount of variation? That is, which set has numbers that differ by the most (among the three sets)?\n\nCan you order the sets in increasing order of their overall variability?\n\nOverall, we can see that the numbers in Set 1 are much closer to each other than those in the other two sets. The numbers in Set 2 are the furthest apart from each other and those in Set 3 are in-between. Therefore the order is: \\newline\\newline Variance of Set 1 \\< Variance of Set 3 \\< Variance of Set 2\n\n## Measuring Variation through *variance*\n\nFrom the foregoing, we see that the variance of a set of numbers is a measure of how much the numbers differ from each other. A set of numbers in which the elements are generally very close together has a low variance and a set that contains numbers that differ from each other by a lot has high variance. Over and above just describing what low and high variance look like, we would like to assign a specific number to the variance of a set of numbers.\n\nIn reality we will compute the variance using the R function *var*. We describe two procedures below just to give you a good feel for what the variance represents.\n\n### Computing Variance: Method 1 -- Using deviations from the mean\n\nWe had earlier mentioned that *variance* is the extent to which the numbers in a collection deviate from the average. We use the following steps.\n\n1.  Find the mean\n\n2.  Find each number's difference from the mean\n\n3.  Square the differences\n\n4.  Average the squared differences (but use (n-1) in the denominator. We show a worked example below.\n\nAgain, we use the same set of numbers (2, 4, 5, 9). Let us suppose that these numbers represent the prices of some items in a shop (in the US) and therefore they represent USD amounts.\n\n#### Steps to compute variance using deviations from the mean\n\n1.  **Find the average of the numbers.**\n\n    The sum of the numbers is:\n\n    2 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 20\n\n    The average is: 20 / 4 = 5\n\n2.  **Find the squared deviations from the mean for each number.**\n\n    | Number | Difference from mean | Difference squared |\n    |--------|----------------------|--------------------|\n    | 2      | 3                    | 9                  |\n    | 4      | 1                    | 1                  |\n    | 5      | 0                    | 0                  |\n    | 9      | 4                    | 16                 |\n\n3.  **Divide the total of the squared deviations from the prior step by (n − 1), where n is the number of elements.**\n\n    The sum of the squared deviations is: 9 + 1 + 0 + 16 = 26\n\n    Dividing by (n − 1): 26 / 3 = 8.66667\n\n::: callout-important\n## Zero variance?\n\nCallout content goes here.\n:::\n\nWhat are the characteristics of a set of numbers with zero variance? Think a little before reading on.\n\nIf the variance has to be zero then. the average of the differences also has to be zero, which means each of the differences has to be zero. That in turn means that all the numbers have to be the same. This makes a lot of sense, because if there is zero or no *variance*, then the numbers do not vary!\n\n### Computing Variance: Preferred Method -- Using R\n\nWe have a data frame named *variance_example* that has a variable *num* with the values (2, 4, 5, 9). We can use the following R code to compute its variance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvariance_example |> \n  summarize(num_var = var(num))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"num_var\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"8.67\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere is another example using the *mpg* data frame to compute the variance of one of its variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg |>\n  summarize(hwy_var = var(hwy))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"hwy_var\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"35.5\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the previous section we computed the variance of a set of numbers that represented USD values. What are the units for variance?\n\n### Unit of measurement for variance\n\nWhenever we measure anything, we measure it in terms of some *unit of measurement*. For example, we might use meter as the *unit of measurement* for people's heights, and USD as the *unit of measurement* for US company profits. In fact, in any data frame, whenever we see a numerical variable, we need to be aware of its *unit of measurement*.\n\nIn the two methods where we computed the variance, we found some differences in each step. These differences were differences between USD amounts and hence the differences have units of USD. We then squared the differences. The unit of measurement for the squares would be USD-squared. We then averaged these in one approach and divided by a number in the other approach to get the variance. Therefore, variance also has USD-squared as its *unit of measurement*.\n\nIn general, when we compute the variance of a variable measured in some units (say, u, the variance has u-squared as its unit of measurement. That is, if we have a variable expressed in meters, then the variance of the variable will be in meters-squared.\n\nWe generally have a clear mental notion of units like USD and meters, but not units like USD-squared or meters-squared.\n\n## Another measure of spread: *Standard Deviation*\n\nWe have seen that *variance* has squared units and we cannot easily relate to these. Statisticians have therefore given us another measure of variability that has the same units as the original variable. This is the *standard deviation* and we compute it as the square-root of the variance.\n\nIf a variable is measured in inches, its variance has inches-squared as its unit. However, when we compute its square root, we get the *standard deviation* with inches as units.\n\nWe can now mentally relate the original variable values to the *standard deviation* and therefore statisticians use this measure very widely. This is not to say that variance is not widely used as well. It is, and we will use it extensively in this course as well.\n\n::: callout-important\n## What information does the standard deviation give us\n\nThe standard deviation tells us the typical distance between a data value and the mean.\n:::\n\n### Computing *standard deviation* using R\n\nWe can use the *sd* function inside the *summarize* function to compute the *standard deviation*\n\nLet us compute the *standard deviation* of the city mileage (variable *cty*) in the *mpg* data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg |>\n  summarize(cty_sd = sd(cty))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"cty_sd\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"4.26\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nJust to confirm that the computed *standard deviation* is in fact the square root of the *variance* let us compute both.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg |>\n  summarize(cty_var = var(cty), cty_sd = sd(cty))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"cty_var\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"cty_sd\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"18.1\",\"2\":\"4.26\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Optional enrichment topic\n\nWe saw two ways to compute variance. There is another method, which, of course, gives the same result, but is quite intriguing, but intuitive.\n\n### Computing Variance: Intriguing Method 1 -- Using pairwise differences\n\nWe first look at an intuitive (but *impractical*) method for computing the variance of a set of numbers. Variance represents how different each member of a set of numbers is from the rest. So the difference between each number and the rest of them plays a central role. Our first approach to computing the variance involves looking at every possible pair of numbers in our set and seeing how different the two numbers of the pair are from each other. We then combine all of these pairwise differences into a single number to represent the overall variability in the set. \\#### Steps to compute variance using pairwise differences\n\nLet us assume that we want to compute the variance of the set of 4 numbers (2, 4, 5, 9)\n\n1.  **Identify each possible pair of numbers from the set.**\n\n    (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 9)\\\n    (4, 5), (4, 9)\\\n    (5, 9)\n\n    There are 6 such pairs.\n\n2.  **Compute the difference for each pair and square it.**\n\n    | Pair   | Difference | Difference squared |\n    |--------|------------|--------------------|\n    | (2, 4) | 2          | 4                  |\n    | (2, 5) | 3          | 9                  |\n    | (2, 9) | 7          | 49                 |\n    | (4, 5) | 1          | 1                  |\n    | (4, 9) | 5          | 25                 |\n    | (5, 9) | 4          | 16                 |\n\n3.  **Find the average of the squared differences.**\n\n    The sum of the squared differences is:\n\n    4 + 9 + 49 + 1 + 25 + 16 = 104\n\n    The average is:\n\n    104 / 6 = 17.33333\n\n4.  **Divide the average from the prior step by 2.**\n\n    17.33333 / 2 = 8.66667\n\n    So, the variance of the set (2, 4, 5, 9) is **8.66667**.\n",
