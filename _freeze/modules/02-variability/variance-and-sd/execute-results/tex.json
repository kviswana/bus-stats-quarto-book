Why? Let us make things more concrete. A data frame with data on employees of a company might have a column named \"salary\" to store the salaries of employees. Salaries of employees vary. That is, we know that not everyone in the company has the same salary (generally speaking). So, it makes eminent sense to call a column a \"variable.\" \n\nSimilarly, the same data frame might have another column named \"Position\" that stores the position of each employee. Some example values might be \"Manager\", \"Sales associate\", and \"IT Specialist.\" Here too we see \"variability\" because not all the values in the column are the same. So the term \"variable\" applies to columns whether they contain numeric or categorical values. However, for the rest of this document, we concern ourselves only with numerical variables.\n\n## Amount of Variation\nMeasuring the amount of variation plays an important role in statistics. If a column has no variation, then we cannot make much use of the information in the column. When a column does have variation, we often want to know the extent of variation in the values of the column. We want to ascribe a specific number -- that is, *measure* the variation in a column. We call this measure the *variance* of the values in a column. When the numbers in a column are all the same, then we say that the column has no variance -- that is, the variance is zero.\n\nConsider the following three sets of 8 numbers each:\\newline\\newline\nSet 1: (1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1)\\newline\nSet 2: (2, 6, 8, 2, 9, 2, 10, 9)\\newline\nSet 3: (1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4)\\newline\\newline\nWhich of the three sets has the highest amount of variation? That is, which set has numbers that differ by the most (among the three sets)?\n\nCan you order the sets in increasing order of their overall variability?\n\nOverall, we can see that the numbers in Set 1 are much closer to each other than those in the other two sets. The numbers in Set 2 are the furthest apart from each other and those in Set 3 are in-between. Therefore the order is: \\newline\\newline\nVariance of Set 1 < Variance of Set 3 < Variance of Set 2\n\n## Measuring Variation\nFrom the foregoing, we see that the variance of a set of numbers is a measure of how much the numbers differ from each other. A set of numbers in which the elements are generally very close together has a low variance and a set that contains numbers that differ from each other by a lot has high variance. Over and above just describing what low and high variance look oike, we would like to assign a specific number to the variance of a set of numbers.\n\nIn reality we will compute the variance using the R function \\textit{var}. We describe two procedures below just to give you a good feel for what the variance represents.\n\n### Computing Variance: Method 1 -- Using pairwise differences\nWe first look at an intuitive (but *impractical*) method for computing the variance of a set of numbers. Variance represents how different each member of a set of numbers is from the rest. So the difference between each number and the rest of them plays a central role. Our first approach to computing the variance involves looking at every possible pair of numbers in our set and seing how different the two numbers of the pair are from each other. We then combine all of these pairwise differences into a single number to represent the overall variability inthe set.\n\n#### Steps to compute variance using pairwise differences\n\nLet us assume that we want to compute the variance of the set of 4 num bers (2, 4, 5, 9)\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Identify each possible pair of numbers from the set.\n\n(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 9)\\\\\n(4, 5), (4, 9)\\\\\n(5, 9)\\\\\nWe have 6 such pairs.\n\n\\item Compute the difference for each pair and square it.\n\n\n\\begin{tabular}{lrr}\n\\toprule\nPair & Difference & Difference squared \\\\\n\\midrule\n(2, 4) & 2 & 4 \\\\\n(2, 5) & 3 & 9 \\\\\n(2, 9) & 7 & 49 \\\\\n(4, 5) & 1 & 1 \\\\\n(4, 9) & 5 & 25 \\\\\n(5, 9) & 4 & 16 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n\\item Find the average of the squared differences. \\newline\nThe sum of the squared differences is\\newline\nSum = 4 + 9 + 49 + 1 + 25 + 16 = 104\\newline\nAverage = 104/6 = 17.33333\n\n\\item Divide the average from the prior step by 2\\newline\n17.33333/2 = 8.66666\\newline\\newline\nSo, the variance of (2, 4, 5, 9) is 8.66667\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n### Computing Variance: Method 2 -- Using deviations from the mean\n\nWe can also compute the variance using a different aproach -- which also gives the same result as method 1. Most people will use this description of variance. Here, instead of finding the pairwise differences, we see how much each number in our set differs from the average (referred to in statistics as the *mean*). We then combine these individual differences into a number that represents the overall variance in the set.\n\nAgain, we use the same set of numbers (2, 4, 5, 9)\n\n#### Steps to compute variance using deviations from the mean\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Find the average of the numbers\\newline\\newline\nSum = 2 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 20\nAverage = 20/4 = 5\n\n\\item Find the squared deviations from the mean for each number.\\newline\\newline\n\\begin{tabular}{lrr}\n\\toprule\nNumber & Difference from mean & Difference squared \\\\\n\\midrule\n2 & 3 & 9 \\\\\n4 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n5 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n9 & 4 & 16 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\item Divide the total of the squared differenbces from the prior step by (n-1) whwre n is the number of elements.\\newline\\newline\nSum of squared deviations = 9 + 1 + 0 + 16 = 26\\newline\nResult of dividing by (n-1) = 26/3 = 8.66667\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n### Computing Variance: Preferred Method -- Using R!\n\nWe have a data frame named *variance_example* that has a variable *num* with the values (2, 4, 5, 9). We can use the following R code to compute its variance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvariance_example |> \n  summarize(num_var = var(num))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\n  num_var\n    <dbl>\n1    8.67\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere is another example using the *mpg* data frame to compute the variance of one of its variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg |>\n  summarize(hwy_var = var(hwy))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\n  hwy_var\n    <dbl>\n1    35.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
