# Module 1: Data, Visualization & Patterns {.unnumbered}

This module introduces the basic building blocks of statistical thinking:
data frames, variables, and point plots. We begin with visualization because
patterns reveal what models will later formalize.

## Learning Goals

- Understand data frames, variables, and instances  
- Create and interpret point plots  
- Recognize patterns: direction, form, strength  

## Structure of This Module

- Data frames  
- Point plots  
- Relationships between variables
