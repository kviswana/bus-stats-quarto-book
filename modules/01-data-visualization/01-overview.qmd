# Module 1: Data, Visualization & Patterns {.unnumbered}

This module introduces the basic building blocks of statistical thinking:
data frames, variables, point plots and relationships. We begin with visualization because
patterns reveal what models will later formalize.

## Learning Outcomes

- Describe data frames, variables, and instances  
- Create and interpret point plots
- Recognize patterns: direction, form, strength  

## Structure of This Module

- Data frames  
- Point plots  
- Relationships between variables
