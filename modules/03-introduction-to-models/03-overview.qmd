# Module 3: Introduction to models

This module gently introduces the idea of a model starting with the idea that the average a variable is a simple and in some sense the *best model* of the variable in the absence of the values of any related variables.

The module introduces the concepts of outcome and explanatory variables.

It then goes on to consider more involved models when the values of other variables are given. Specifically it considers the idea of the *best model* for a variable if we know the value of a related categorical variable.

## Learning Goals

-   a
-   b
-   c

## Structure of This Module

-   Average or mean as the *best model*
-   What does it mean for one variable to *explain* another?
-   Response and explanatory variables (in this course we consider only numerical response variables)
-   Mean as the model with no explanatory variables
-   Best model with one categorical explanatory variable
