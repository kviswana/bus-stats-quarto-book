## Let's play *What's your best guess?*{#sec-mean-game}

Let us play a game. I have the following set of 10 numbers:

4, 5, 7, 1, 8, 4, 3, 9, 5, 4

Here are the steps in the game:

1.  I will pick a number at random from this set
2.  You have to guess the number that I chose
3.  I reveal my choice.
4.  We compute the difference between your guess and my chosen number (error) and square it

We will repeat this process 10 times and compute your score as the sum of all the 20 results (squared-differences) from the last step. Your goal is to keep this sum as small as possible.

Let us look at one play:

| Choice | Guess |         Err | Err-sq |
|:------:|:-----:|------------:|-------:|
|   9    |   1   |          -8 |     64 |
|   9    |   4   |          -5 |     25 |
|   4    |   3   |          -1 |      1 |
|   5    |   4   |          -1 |      1 |
|   5    |   4   |          -1 |      1 |
|   5    |   1   |          -4 |     16 |
|   4    |   9   |           5 |     25 |
|   8    |   1   |          -7 |     49 |
|   4    |   5   |           1 |      1 |
|   5    |   5   |           0 |      0 |
|   4    |   4   |           0 |      0 |
|   4    |   5   |           1 |      1 |
|   3    |   3   |           0 |      0 |
|   7    |   8   |           1 |      1 |
|   1    |   4   |           3 |      9 |
|   1    |   4   |           3 |      9 |
|   4    |   7   |           3 |      9 |
|   8    |   4   |          -4 |     16 |
|   4    |   5   |           1 |      1 |
|   9    |   1   |          -8 |     64 |
|        |       | Total error |    293 |

Let us see another play with the same choices, but different guesses.

| Choice | Guess |        Diff | Diff-sq |
|:------:|:-----:|------------:|--------:|
|   9    |   9   |           0 |       0 |
|   9    |   5   |          -4 |      16 |
|   4    |   3   |          -1 |       1 |
|   5    |   4   |          -1 |       1 |
|   5    |   8   |           3 |       9 |
|   5    |   8   |           3 |       9 |
|   4    |   1   |          -3 |       9 |
|   8    |   3   |          -5 |      25 |
|   4    |   5   |           1 |       1 |
|   5    |   4   |          -1 |       1 |
|   4    |   9   |           5 |      25 |
|   4    |   4   |           0 |       0 |
|   3    |   5   |           2 |       4 |
|   7    |   5   |          -2 |       4 |
|   1    |   5   |           4 |      16 |
|   1    |   3   |           2 |       4 |
|   4    |   4   |           0 |       0 |
|   8    |   7   |          -1 |       1 |
|   4    |   4   |           0 |       0 |
|   9    |   5   |          -4 |      16 |
|        |       | Total error |     142 |

And one more:

| Choice | Guess |        Diff | Diff-sq |
|:------:|:-----:|------------:|--------:|
|   9    |   5   |          -4 |      16 |
|   9    |   7   |          -2 |       4 |
|   4    |   3   |          -1 |       1 |
|   5    |   5   |           0 |       0 |
|   5    |   3   |          -2 |       4 |
|   5    |   4   |          -1 |       1 |
|   4    |   5   |           1 |       1 |
|   8    |   9   |           1 |       1 |
|   4    |   9   |           5 |      25 |
|   5    |   9   |           4 |      16 |

|   4    |   7   |           3 |       9 |
|   3    |   4   |           1 |       1 |
|   7    |   5   |          -2 |       4 |
|   1    |   1   |           0 |       0 |
|   1    |   7   |           6 |      36 |
|   4    |   5   |           1 |       1 |
|   8    |   7   |          -1 |       1 |
|   4    |   5   |           1 |       1 |
|   9    |   1   |          -8 |      64 |
|        |       | Total error |     186 |

Of the three plays, the second play had the lowest total difference and emerged as the best of the three.

However, can we do even better? What approach will help us to reduce this total difference or error?

## Average or *mean* as the best guess in the long run

It turns out that when we have a large number of tries, we will get the best results, that is the lowest sum of squared errors when we always guess the average of the numbers. In this case the average is 5 and so if we guess 5 everytime we get the best results in the long run. Here is an example for the same choices:

| Choice | Mean guess |        Diff | Diff-sq |
|:------:|:----------:|------------:|--------:|
|   9    |     5      |          -4 |      16 |
|   9    |     5      |          -4 |      16 |
|   4    |     5      |           1 |       1 |
|   5    |     5      |           0 |       0 |
|   5    |     5      |           0 |       0 |
|   5    |     5      |           0 |       0 |
|   4    |     5      |           1 |       1 |
|   8    |     5      |          -3 |       9 |
|   4    |     5      |           1 |       1 |
|   5    |     5      |           0 |       0 |
|   4    |     5      |           1 |       1 |
|   4    |     5      |           1 |       1 |
|   3    |     5      |           2 |       4 |
|   7    |     5      |          -2 |       4 |
|   1    |     5      |           4 |      16 |
|   1    |     5      |           4 |      16 |
|   4    |     5      |           1 |       1 |
|   8    |     5      |          -3 |       9 |
|   4    |     5      |           1 |       1 |
|   9    |     5      |          -4 |      16 |
|        |            | Total error |     113 |

We can see that the total error is smaller than any of the others. What we have said above **does not mean that we are guaranteed to get the smallest total error if we guess the average**. Clearly, if someone were lucky enough to guess all the numbers correctly, then their total error will be zero! Also, it is possible that someone could guess many numbers correctly just by chance and get a lower error than 113. However, those occurrences are unlikely in the long run. *Statistically* and realistically, the best course would be to guess the average.

## What is a model?

People us ethe word *model* in many senses. In one of the more common usages, a model is an approximate representation of something for some purpose.

@fig-house and @fig-house-model show the image of a house and a miniature model of it. The miniature is a good representation of the house in some respoects. For example, it depicts the overall shape and some exterior details quite accurately. If someone were about to build a new house and the architect showed them this model, they would get a good idea about the overall external appearance of the house and the color scheme as well. However, this model differs from the actual house in many ways as well -- one cannot actually step inside it! We cannot get a feel for how roomy the interios=r will feel. We do not know how the house will look in its actual surroundings. It is accurate in some respects and inaccurate in others. 


![Picture of a house](../../images/fig-house.png){#fig-house width=70% fig-align="center"}


![Model of the house in @fig-house](../../images/fig-house-model.png){#fig-house-model width=70% fig-align="center"}


Should we consider the model in @fig-house-model good? In the words of statistician George E. P. Box, "All models are wrong. But some are useful for certain purposes." 

All models are wrong in the sense that they are only *representations*. However, as the miniature model of the house in @fig-house-model, they can still be useful for some purpose.

We will be building many models in this course and should remember the folloiwng:

- Models are simplifications: They inherently omit details and idealize reality to make complex systems manageable.
- Utility over accuracy: The goal isn't perfect truth, but practical application and insight for a specific goal, whether it's scientific, business, or everyday decision-making.
- Context matters: A model's usefulness depends on the purpose; a simple model might be great for a quick estimate, while a complex one is needed for detailed forecasting.
- Pragmatic approach: We should focus on how wrong a model can be and still be helpful, rather than getting stuck on its imperfections. 

How to apply this philosophy:

- Question your models: Continuously ask how and where a model breaks down.
- Understand its limitations: Know the assumptions and simplifications behind the model.
- Adapt and evolve: Be willing to refine or discard models as new information emerges or situations change. 



## Mathematical models

In this course, we will be building a specific kind of models -- *statistical models*. However, before getting to *statistical* models, we will consider some simpler *mathematical models*. The term *mathgematical model* can connote many different things. Let us clarify the sense in which we use the term. Suppose I have a data frame with data about many homes. For each home, we have its *age*, *floor-area_sqft*, *number_of_bedrooms*, *number_of_bathrooms*, and *price*. 

We might build a model to determine the value of *price* given the values of one or more of the other variables. Remember, this is a model and so we do not expect it be be exact. We do not aim for the model  not determininbg the actual *price*, but only to compute a good *estimate* of the *price*. (We have obviously simplified the situation for pedagogical purposes. House prices depend on many other factors. But that need not hold us back. You will still learn the underlying concepts.) S, what might the model look like? @eq-price-model shows the model. For now, do not worry about how we arrived the model.

$$
\widehat{\text{price}} = 61{,}399 + 394\,\text{floor\_area\_sqft}
$${#eq-price-model}


In the model, we have placed a *hat* over *price* because the model computes not the actual price of a home with the specified floor area and instead only computes an estimate. In statistics, we place a *hat* over quantities that estimate other quantities.

@eq-price-model shows a *linear* model. We call it *linear* because all variables are only raised to the fist power. We have not squared or raised a variable to any other power. In this course we build only *linear models*.

In our context, we use the term *model* to denote a mathematical equation of the kind that @eq-price-model shows. Our models help us to determine the value of a variable in a data frame for any given instance. Specifically, in the house price example that we just considered, the model in @eq-price-model enables us to estimate the *price* of a home, given its floor area. 

### *Response* and *Explanatory* variables

We call the variable whose value the model estimates as the *response* variable. The variables based on which the model estimates the *reponse* variable are called *explanatory* variables. We can also refer to the *response* variable as the *dependent* variable, and *explanatory* variables as *independent* variables.

### Using the model

The house in the fifth row of the data frame has floor area of 1480. Its actual price is $553,000. What price does the model estimate? Well, we can plug the floor area into the model -- @eq-price-model -- and find out. If we plug it in, we get $645,999. The model overestimates this price.

The house in the fourteenth row of the data frame has floor area of 1293 Its actual price is $561,000. What price does the model estimate? Well, we can plug the floor area into the model -- @eq-price-model -- and find out. If we plug it in, we get $572,134. Quite close.

You should try out some more cases and wee how the model does. We will learn a lot more about such models, including precisely measuring their *quality* as we go forward. 

I won't blame you if you are wondering "We already have the prices in the data frame. Why do we need a model to calculate these?" 

Consider again the home in the fifth row. Why did the model overestimate the price? Well, you should consider that this particular home was not the only one whose floor area was in the vicinity of 1480. The dataset has other homes with similar floor areas and their prices vary. If we look at homes that have floor areas between 1430 and 1530, we see that their proces range from $553,000 to $647,000. In fact, many homes below 1480 square feet in floor area have higher prices. How could that be? Well, variables other than floor area play a role in price too. So our model makes an estimate based on the whole data frame.

The next section addresses two main uses of models.

## Purpose of a model

We use models in two main ways:

1. *Prediction*: Suppose we have built a model using the data in a data frame to estimate the *price* of a home, given its *floor_area_sqft*. We can potentially use this model to estimate the price of any home whose floor area we know and shose price we do not know -- even if this home is not in the dataset. 
1. *Explanation*: Our model in @eq-price-model tells us that the price of a home is related to its floor area. This makes sense and we could have said this even without a model. However, when people gather data about phenomena that they do not fully understand, and want to understand, they often build models to understand and explain which variables seem to be related and in what way to a variable of interest.

You might have noted that both of the above purposes actually require us to use a model in contexts that go outside the data that we based the model on. When we start using models outside of the data we used to build the model, we come face to face with the essence of statistics. We will get to that later in the course. 

## Average is a model too!

In @eq-price-model, we had a *response* variable and an *explanatory* variable. What if we do not have any explanatory variable? In the context of our home prices example, not having an *explanatory* variable is equivalent to saying: 

- "I have a dataset of 100 homes"
- "Here are their prices" 
- "I am not telling you anything else about these homes"
- "I have selected a random home from my dataset"
- "Guess the price of the home I nhave in mind"

Based on the game we played at the start of this chapter, you first compute the average of the prices as $733,440. Your best *model* to make your guess is:


$$
\widehat{\text{price}} = 733{,}440
$${#eq-avg-price-model}

That is, like in the game we played, no matter which home I choose, you always state the average as your guess.

The big difference between the models in @eq-price-model and @eq-avg-price-model is that the second one *has no explanatory variable*. When we are not given any additional helpful information to estimate a value, our best estimate -- *best model* -- is the average!

Now you know why I titled the chapter **The Simplest Model**
