# Module 4: Linear Regression Models {.unnumbered}

This module fills in the details on top of the intutional foundation for a linear model that the previous module laid. Specifically, the module covers R code for building linear models for the case of a single linear explanatory variable, a single categorical variable and a combination of numerical and categorical explanatory variables.It shows how to distill the model function based on the regression output.

## Structure of This Module

- Notion of model function
- mention that the model gives an estimated value, but defer detailed discussion until later
- R code for building model with no explanatory variable and reconstructing the model function
- R code for building model with one numeric explanatory variable and reconstructing the model function
- R code for building model with one numeric explanatory variable and one categorical explanatory variable and reconstructing the model function
