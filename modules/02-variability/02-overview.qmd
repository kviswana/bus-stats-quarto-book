# Module 2: Variation {.unnumbered}

Variation plays a very important role in statistics. Some even go to the extent of viewing the discipline of statistics itself as the study of variation.

This module discusses variation generally by visualizing it through *violin* plots. It then introduces the key statistical concepts of *variance* and *standard deviation* and how to compute these using R.
