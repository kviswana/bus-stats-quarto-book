# Module 2: Variation {.unnumbered}

Variation plays a very important role in statistics. Some even go to the extent of viewing the discipline of statistics itself as the study of variation.

This module discusses variation generally by visualizing it through *violin* plots. It then introduces the key statistical concepts of *variance* and *standard deviation* and how to compute these using R.

## Learning Goals

- Explain what variability in a variable represents
- Plot and interpret violin plots
- Identify broad characteristics of distribution shapes
- Compute variance and standard deviation of a small set of numbers by hand
- Use R to compute the variance and standard deviation of variables in a data frame
- 

## Structure of This Module

  - Violin plots
  - Variance and standard deviation
