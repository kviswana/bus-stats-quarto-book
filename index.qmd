This text presents a modren, modeling-first approach to business statistics.
Rather than a traditional probability-first sequence, we begin with data,
relationships, patterns, models, and regression — the tools most relevant to
business decision-making in marketing, finance, economics, HR, and analytics.

You will learn:

- how to visualize data  
- how to describe relationships  
- how to build regression models  
- how to interpret uncertainty  
- how to make data-driven decisions  

Let’s get started.
