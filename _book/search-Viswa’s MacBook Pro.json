Each row represents an occurence of the topic. For example, Table 1.1 contains data about the results of the Boston Marathon over the years. Each row represents the result for one year, for one gender. We also refer to a row as an observation, or as an instance, or in a medical or biology context, as a specimen.\nEach column represents some attribute of interest about instances. In Table 1.1, we have columns to represent the year of the race, the name, county and sex of the winner and the finishing time.\nIn statistics, we generally refer to columns of a data frame as variables. We explain why in Section 1.4.\nIn the 1880’s, Francis Galton was developing ways to quantify the heritability of traits. As part of this work, he collected data on the heights of adult children and their parents. Table 1.2 shows the initial few rows of that data.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: Galton data (first 10 rows).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfamily\nfather\nmother\nsex\nheight\nnkids\n\n\n\n\n1\n78.5\n67.0\nM\n73.2\n4\n\n\n1\n78.5\n67.0\nF\n69.2\n4\n\n\n1\n78.5\n67.0\nF\n69.0\n4\n\n\n1\n78.5\n67.0\nF\n69.0\n4\n\n\n2\n75.5\n66.5\nM\n73.5\n4\n\n\n2\n75.5\n66.5\nM\n72.5\n4\n\n\n2\n75.5\n66.5\nF\n65.5\n4\n\n\n2\n75.5\n66.5\nF\n65.5\n4\n\n\n3\n75.0\n64.0\nM\n71.0\n2\n\n\n3\n75.0\n64.0\nF\n68.0\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 1.2, each row represents an adult child. The variables in this data frame represent the father’s height (father), mother’s height (mother), sex of the adult child (sex), height of the adult child (height), and the number of children (nkinds) in the family. Each family also has a unique number for each family (family).",

Going forward, we will use the term variable to refer to a column of a data frame.\nIn this course, you will be working with many data frames. You should always be sure to understand what a row of a data frame contains information about. In the case of Table 1.1, each row rewpresents the results of one race.

    "text": "1.6 Data Frames in R\nIn this section we look at the practical side of data frames – using them in R. We will only look at using data frames that are built in to the LSTbook package and mecome available as soon as we load the package LSTbook. If you have not already done so, you should install R and RStudio and learn how o use RStudio using the instructions from Chapter 31.\n\n1.6.1 Viewing the first few rows of a data frame\nIn an RStudio command prompt you can enter the name of the data frame to get a preview of its contents.\n\nBoston_marathon\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLet us understand the output above. The first row says:\n# A tibble: 175 × 6\nThis says that the data frame (also called tibble) has 175 rows and 6 columns.\nThe second line mentiones the column (variable) names. The third line has sone specific notation within angle brackets below each variable. This is telling us what type of value is stored in each column. -  means that the value in a column is a double, that is, number that could potentially have a fractional part. -  means that the column has character or non-numeric values -  tells us that the column stores a time - and so on.\nIf the data frame has many columns and all of them will not fit in our output width, it will only display the columns that will fit and provide information below about the additional columns. In the present case all columns do fit and so there is not additional information provided.\n\n\n1.6.2 Functions\nYou are likely familiar with the term functions as used in mathematics – you rpovide an input to the function and it performs some computation and provides an output. For example, we might have a function that takes a number as input and produces its square as output. Given the number 5 as input, it will produce the number 25 as its output. Given the number 1.5 as input, it will produce its square 2.25 as its output.\nPictorially we might represent a function as a box that has one or more inputs and produces a single output. (We can also have functions that take no inputs and produce an output, but we will not worry about them now.) See Figure 1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A function that squares its input\n\n\n\nWe might have functions that take more than one input. For example, a function might take two inputs x and y, and produce 23 + 3x + 4y as output. Figure 1.2 shows a function with two inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: A function that computes 23+3x+4y where x and y are its inputs\n\n\n\nIn computing, we commonly refer to a function’s inputs as its arguments. Figure 1.3 illustrates this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: We generally refer to a function’s inputs as its arguments – this function has two arguments, x and y\n\n\n\nThe functions we considered in our examples thus far in Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2, and Figure 1.3 have been so simple that we were able to show the actual computation in the box representing the function. Most functions we use in real-life are more complex and we give them evocative names. In such cases, it makes more sense to place the name of the function in the box. Figure 1.4 shows a generirc repesentation of a function named cost with three arguments named arg1, arg2, and arg3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Generic representation of a function named cost that has three arguments\n\n\n\nWhen we use a function to perform some computation, we are said to invoke the function. We generally invoke a function by using its name and by supplying the argument values in parentheses, as Figure 1.5 shows. We also use the term passing arguments to functions to refer to the act of supplying the inputs to a function. We also refer to the result of a function as its return value. We will also speak of a function as returning something. Figure 1.5 also shows that a function argumnent can be numeric or non-numeric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Invoking a named function and storing the function’s return value in a variable named total\n\n\n\nIn the next section, we look at using functions to perform computing in R. At that time we will look at a different way of passing arguments to functions.\nAlmost all forms of computing, including statistical computing, make significant use of functions. In this course, many of the functions we use take data frame as input and produce a data frame as output. Let us now look at how we use functions in R to work with data and to perform statistical computations.",

    "section": "1.7 Using R functions",
    "text": "1.7 Using R functions\nWe will now look at some common R functions that we will use repeatedly in this course.\n\n1.7.1 nrow\nWe will consider the nrow() function that allows us to find out how many rows a data frame contains. We pass a data frame as argument to the nrow() function and it returns a number specifying how many rows the argument data frame has. For example, to find out how many rows the Boston_marathon data frame has, we can use the following code.\n\nnrow(Boston_marathon)\n\n[1] 175\n\n\nIn the code above, we used the style of function invocation that Figure 1.5 introduced.\n\n\n1.7.2 The pipe operator\nIn this course we also use another method of passing an argument to a function – via pipes. Let us first see the code and then learn how it works. We will invoke the nrow() function again, but using a different approach. The code below does exactly what the earlier code accomplished – finding the number of rows in a data frame.\n\nBoston_marathon |&gt; nrow()\n\n[1] 175\n\n\nIn the code above, we are still passing the Boston_marathon data frame as an argument to the nrow() function, but we are passing it along a pipe which appears in the code as “|&gt;”.\nFigure 1.6 clarifies code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Using the pipe operator to supply the Boston_marathon data frame as an argument to the norw function\n\n\n\nThe pipe operator “|&gt;” has the effect of injecting whatever appears on its left hand side as an argument to the function on the right hand side. Figure 1.7 makes this very explicit by literally depicting the pipe operator “|&gt;” as a physical pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Seeing the pipeoprtator literally as a pipe though which the argument flows into a function\n\n\n\nGoing forward, we will use this pipe approach extensively, but also mix in the earlier approach in places. You will catch on to our patters pretty easily.\n\n\n1.7.3 ncol\nWe can use the ncol() function to find the number of columns in a data frame.\n\nBoston_marathon |&gt; ncol()\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nThe above shows us that the Boston_marathon data frame has 6 columns or variables.\n\n\n1.7.4 head\nYou can use the head() function to preview the first several rows of a data frame. This time we will use the Births2022 data frame from the LSTbook package.\n\nBirths2022 |&gt; head()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe above previewed the first six rows of Births2022 by default because we did not specify how many rows we wanted. We can specify that explicitly. The following previews the first 10 rows.\n\nBirths2022 |&gt; head(10)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.5 names\nWe use this to find the names of the columns in a data frame.\n\nBirths2022 |&gt; names()\n\n [1] \"month\"           \"dow\"            \n [3] \"place\"           \"paternity\"      \n [5] \"meduc\"           \"feduc\"          \n [7] \"married\"         \"fage\"           \n [9] \"mage\"            \"total_kids\"     \n[11] \"interval\"        \"prenatal_start\" \n[13] \"prenatal_visits\" \"mheight\"        \n[15] \"wt_pre\"          \"wt_delivery\"    \n[17] \"diabetes_pre\"    \"diabetes_gest\"  \n[19] \"hbp_pre\"         \"hbp_gest\"       \n[21] \"eclampsia\"       \"induction\"      \n[23] \"augmentation\"    \"anesthesia\"     \n[25] \"presentation\"    \"method\"         \n[27] \"trial_at_labor\"  \"attendant\"      \n[29] \"payment\"         \"apgar5\"         \n[31] \"apgar10\"         \"plurality\"      \n[33] \"sex\"             \"duration\"       \n[35] \"menses\"          \"weight\"         \n[37] \"living\"          \"breastfed\"      \n\n\n\n\n1.7.6 summarize\nWe often calculate summaries (like the average of a variable) of the data contained in a data frame. We will discuss other examples of summaries – like variance, standard deviation, covariance, and correlation coefficient – at appropriate points in the course.\nThe code below shows how to compute the average of the time variable in the Boston_marathon data frame.\n\nBoston_marathon |&gt; \n  summarize(avg_time = mean(time))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn the above code, we passed the Boston_marathon data frame via a pipe to the summarize function. Within the summarize function, we have used the R function mean to compute the average by passing the variable time as an argument to the mean function.\nWe chose to name the return value from the mean function (the average time) as avg_time. You do not necessarily need to name the summaries we compute in the summarize function, but we strongly recommend it.\nFor most of the summaries we compute we will use the general summarize function. WIthin the summarize function, we use specific functions depending on the kind of summary we are computing. In the previous example, we used the mean function for the average. Later we will see other functions to use within the summarize function.\n\n\n1.7.7 count\nThe count() function comes in handy when we want to count how many occurrences of each distinct value in a column are present in a variable. For example, suppose we want to find how many rows are there for each sex we can do the following.\n\nBoston_marathon |&gt; count(sex)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSimilarly, if we wanted to find out how many times each country occurs, we can do this.\n\nBoston_marathon |&gt; count(country)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAs you can see, the count() function comes in most handy when a variable is categorical. It also works for numerical variables, but will apply much more rarely in these cases.",

    "text": "1.8 Missing values (NAs)\nSuppose the HR department of a company has a data frame of information about employees with variables (columns) employee_id, first_name, last_name, base_salary, phone_no, and base_office. It is not essential that we have data on every variabkle for every row. For example, it could be the case that the company does not have a phone_no for some employees and does not have a base_office for some. These are called missing values. A missing value denotes somnething whose value we do not know. A missing value is not the same as a blank character value or a zero numeric value.

    "text": "2.2 Plotting the relationship between two numerical variables\nThe point_plot() function that we will rely on for plots in this course lives in the LSTbook package. We will be using the LSTextras package. Once we load the LSTextras package (which in turn loads the LSTbook package and all its dependencies), the point_plot() function becomes available for us to use.\nLet us first look at the price_demand data frame that is built into the LSTbook package.\nA hypothetical company has gathered data for a single product. Over time, and across very similar sales areas, the company has charged different prices for the same product, It has recorded the monthly sales for each price. The dataset price_demand contains the price and the corresponding sales quantities. We would like to study if the two variables price and sales_qty are related in any way.\nFirst let us see some rows from the dataset.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Price Demand data (first 15 rows)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprice\nsales_qty\n\n\n\n\n11.8\n1260\n\n\n12.1\n1215\n\n\n13.6\n1214\n\n\n12.3\n1298\n\n\n12.4\n1160\n\n\n13.7\n1138\n\n\n12.6\n1174\n\n\n11.2\n1220\n\n\n11.7\n1313\n\n\n11.9\n1283\n\n\n13.3\n1170\n\n\n12.6\n1247\n\n\n12.6\n1283\n\n\n12.3\n1263\n\n\n11.8\n1259\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full dataset has 500 rows. With so many rows, we cannot easily get a handle on the overall pattern by looking at the data directly. Visualizing the data might help us. We will do several things in this section: - generate the plot using R code - understand how each element of the plot is related to the original dataset - understand the various elements of the code so that you can use similar code to generate plots that you many need - interpret the plot\nThe code and the plot appear below. For now, ignore the code. We will discuss it in detail after analyzing the plot itself.\n\nprice_demand |&gt; \n  point_plot(sales_qty ~ price)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Price demand relationship\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1 shows the relationship between price and sales_qty – the two variables in the data frame. Note the following about the plot:\n\nThe plot has two axes – the x-axis along the width and the y-axis along tbe height.\nThe plot shows thge values of price on the x-axis and the values of sales_qty on the y-axis.\nIf you take any single point on the plot, you can drop a vertical line from the point to the x-axis and the point where it intersects the x-axis is the price corresponding to the point.\nSimilarly, if you draw a horizontal line from the point to intersect the y-axis, you get the sales_qty corresponding to that point.\nEach point of the plot corresponds to one row of the dataset. So how many points are on the plot? 500, since the dataset has 500 rows.\nThus given a point on the plot, we should be able to identify a corresponding row of the data frame\nGiven a row of the data frame, we should be able to identify a corresponding point on the plot.\n\n\n2.2.1 Finding the point corresponding to a row of the data frame\nLet us now try to find the point on the plot corrresponding to the first row in Figure 2.1.\nThe first row of the data frame has price = 11.8 and sales_qty = 1260. Therefore, we can find the point by drawing a vertical line from 11.8 on the x-axis to intersect a horizontal line from 1260 on the y-axis. Figure 2.2 illustrates this. We have highlighted the point by enlarging it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Finding the first row of the price_demand data frame on the plot: price = 11.8, sales_qty = 1260\n\n\n\nSimilarly, let us locate the point corresponding to row 11 (price = 13.3, sales_qty = 1170).\nfollowing the same approach we arrive at Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Finding the eleventh row of the price_demand data frame on the plot: price = 13.3, sales_qty = 1170\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Finding the price and sales_qty corresponding to a point on the plot\nWe can reverse the above process to find the variable values (and hence the actual row) corresponding to a point on the plot. We will simply drop a vertical line from the point down to the x-axis to get the price and draw a horizontal line from the point to the y-axis to determine the sales_qty. The figure will look similar to the prior two figures.\n\n\n2.2.3 Dissecting the code\nFigure 2.4 decodes the various elements of the code that we used to generate out first point plot in Figure 2.1. We see that we pass the data frame price_demand to the point_plot function through the pipe operator. We add the tilde expression for the plot as an additional argument.\nFigure 2.5 shows us that the point_plot function maps the variable on the left of the tilde operator to the y-axis of the plot and maps the variable to the right of the tilde expression to the x-axis of the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Passing the price_demand data frame as argument to the point_plot function through the pipe operator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Using a tilde expression to map variables to the axes\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Interpreting the plot\nFigure 2.6 repeats the plot of price versus sales_qty.\n\nprice_demand |&gt; \n  point_plot(sales_qty ~ price)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Price demand relationship (again)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see a clear trend showing that, in general, higher prices correspond to lower values of sales quantity.\nTo be sure, this is only a trend and not a strict rule. That is, given any two points, we do not have a guarantee that the point with the higher price will always have a lower sales quantity. However, this will be true for most of the pairs of points. Figure 2.7 illustrates this with some randomly selected pairs of points. We see that most of the lines point down and to the right – meaning that for most pairs of points, the one with higher price has a lower sales_qty. However, we also see a few examples where the opposite is true.\nThis is why we only calls this a trend and not a strict rule about the relationship between price and sales_qty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Line segments connecting some pairs of points showing that for most pairs of points the point with higher price has lower sales_qty\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Positive and negative relationships\nIn general, when we discuss the relationship between two numerical variables, if the general trend is that higher values of one correspond to higher values of the other, then we have a positive relationship. On the other hand, is higher values of one variable correspond to lower values of the other then we have a negative relationship.\nWhat kind of relationship does Figure 2.6 show – positive or negative?\nYou got it right if you said negative – higher values of price correspond to lower values of sales_qty.\nFigure 2.8 shows two positively correlated variables. Here, higher values of one variable are generally related to higher values of the other. We used the advertising_sales_channel data frame for this plot.\n\nadvertising_sales_channel |&gt; \n  point_plot(weekly_sales_k ~ advertising_spend_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Weekly sales and advertising spend have a positive relationship – higher advertising generally has higher weekly sales\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data frame returns_dpo contains hypothetical data on various firms’ daily stock returns and the number of days they take to pay their suppliers. Figure 2.9 shows the relationship between these variables. We cannot spot any trend. Higher or lower values of one variable do not indicate higher or lower values of the other. Hence there is neither a positive relationship nor a negative one.\n\nreturns_dpo |&gt; \n  point_plot(daily_return ~ dpo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Days payment outstanding (dpo) does not have a relationship to the daily stock return\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Putting a number on the relationship: The correlation coefficient\nThus far, we have been talking about relationships between variables. Exact sciences like mathematics and statistics like to be precise and assign numbers where possible. Statistics commonly uses the correlation coefficient to quantify the relationship between two numerical variables. This section just introduces the correlation coefficient and shows you how to compute it using R. We will get into the mechanics of the actual computation later in the book.\nThe correlation coefficient can take a value between -1 and +1. A value of 0 signifies a complete absence of relationship. -1 signifies a perfect negative correlation and +1 signifies a perfact positive correlation. We discuss these ideas below.\nWe look at some examples now. Revisiting the price_demand data frame, let us use R to compute the correlation coefficient between the variables price and sales_qty.\n\nprice_demand |&gt; \n  summarize(price_sales_qty_correlation = cor(price, sales_qty))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe are computing a summary and hence use the summarize function (see Section 1.7.6). Since the summary we are computing now is the correlation coefficient, we use the cor function within the summarize function. We have chosen to call the comoputed result price_sales_qty_correlation. We could have named it anything we wanted, but chose the sensible approach of giving it a meaningul name.\nFigure 2.1 had already shown us the negative relationship between price and sales_qty. The correlation confirms it, … and makes it more precise.\nLet us compute the correlation coefficient between advertising spend and the weekly sales from the advertising_sales_channel data frame. From Figure 2.8 we saw that these two variables are positively related. Let us see what the correlation coefficient says.\n\nadvertising_sales_channel |&gt; \n  summarize(ad_sales_corr = cor(advertising_spend_k, weekly_sales_k))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSure enough, we see a positive correlation coefficient.\n\n\n2.2.7 Perfect correlation\nConsider Figure 2.10 showing strong, but imperfect, correlation.\n\nprice_demand |&gt; \n  point_plot(sales_qty ~ price)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Price and sales_qty are not perfectly correlated – correlation coefficient is -0.75\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have already established that price and sales_qty are negatively related. That is, there is a general pattern that higher values of price have lower values of sales_qty.\nIn Figure 2.10, if we look only at the points corresponding to a particular value of price, say 13, the points along this vertical line range from approximately 1100 to 1320. That is, given a value of price, we cannot be sure about the exact value of the corresponding value of sales_qty. However, knowing price does give us some idea about sale_qty. This shows relationship, but not perfect correlation.\nWhen the correlation coefficient is +1 or -1, we have perfect correlation. In this case, knowing the value of one variable enables us to precisely know the value of the other variable as well. This happens when all the points lie on a straight line instead of being dispersed as a cloud as in Figure 2.10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Perfect correlation arises when all the points lie perfectly on a straight line – the variables in this plot have a corelation coefficient of +1\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11 shows a situation when all points lie on a perfect straight line. In this case, given a value for one variable, we can determine exactly the value of the other. We can determine it visually or by plugging the value of the known variable into the following equation and calculating the value of the other variable.\n\ntotal_cost = 10000 + 45*units_produced\n\nIn Figure 2.11 the line slopes upward as it goes from left to right. WHen the line on which all points fall slopes down as it goes right, the correlation is still perfect, but the line slopes down as it goes to the right and so we have a correlation coefficien of -1.\n\n\n2.2.8 How the point cloud looks for various correlation coefficients\nFigure 2.12 shows the point plots for various values of correlation coefficients between -1 and +1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Point plots for various correlation-coefficients (r)\n\n\n\nYou can see the following: - in the plot wigth correlation coefficient = -1 (r = -1), the points align perfectly on a straight line sloping downwards as the x values increase - at +1 they align perfactly on a line sloping upwards as the x values increase - as the coefficient goes from -1 to 0, the points get more scattered away from perfect alignment on a straightline until at 0 there is no pattern whatsoever - as the correlation coefficient increases from 0 to +1, we see that the tendency to align on a straight line increases until perfect alignment at r = 1.",

In Figure 2.8 we have the variable advertising_spend_k on the x-axis. Being a numerical variable, it can potentially take on any value on the x-axis.

However, we can often get more insights if we manage to get more variables into our plots. The point_plot functions allows us to bring one more dimension to our plots through color.\nIn Figure 2.8, we saw the positive relationship between weekly_sales_k and advertising_spend_k in the advertising_sales_channel data frame.

From it we can clearly see that the points corresponding to each sales channel clearly shows the positive relationship that we saw earlier. But this plot also shows that for a given value of advertising_spend_k the Retail Promo channel generally has a comparatively higher weekly_sales_k value. Adding the variable channel through color enabled us to see more into the data than before.\n\n2.4.1 Understanding the tilde expression to add a third variable\nFigure 2.15 shows the tilde expression we used in a point plot of two variables to color the points based on a third variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: To color the points based on the value of a third variable, we just add it to the end of the tilde-expression after a plus sign\n\n\n\n?fig-color-tilde-expression-2 shows another example.

    "text": "3.1 Distribution\nWe have already looks at the concept of variable. We have used the term to refer to a column of a data frame. We explained the rationale for the name from the fact that the values in a single column of a data frame vary. That is, not all the rows of a column have the same value. For example, we see in Table 3.1 that the values in the column minutes vary – that is, not all the values in the column are the same. The same is true of every column.\nTake care to note that we are not saying that every value in a column has to be distinct. Values can repeat. However we have variety in a column as long as all the values are not the same. Very rarely will you come across data frames in which all the values of a column are the same. In this case the column does not serve any useful purpose for data analysis.\nIn this course, we deal only with variability in numerical variables. Statistics deals with variability in categorical variables as well, but this book does not consider this in any depth.\nBefore we look at the distribution of variables in a data frame, let us look at variability in sets of numbers to understand the idea of distribution.

    "text": "3.1.1 Uniform distribution\nSuppose we have 1000 numbers with each one being an integer between 1 and 100. Some of the numbers in this data might be 45, 23, 46, 89, 1, 23, 45, 56, and so on. If each number occurs exactly 10 times – that is we have 10 ones, 10 twos and so on up to 10 hundreds, we have what is called as the uniform distrigution. In a uniform distribution, each number in the range of the list occurs the same number of times.\nFigure 3.1 shows a histogram of a set of numbers. A histogram breaks up the whole range of the data points into bins. In our example, the numbers range from 1 to 100. A histogram might break this up into some number of bins. If the number of bins is 10, then the numbers between 1 and 10 will fall unto 1 bin. The numbers between 11 and 20 into the next bin and so on. In this example, the bin-width is 10 because each bin spans a range of size 10. The x-axis of the histogram shows the number values and a bar for each bin. The y axis shows how many of the numbers fall into each bin and so the pattern formed by the heights of the bars helps us to see the distribution of the numbers.\nFigure 3.1 shows numbers that are perfectly uniformly distributed. We have used a bin-width of 1 to have each individual integer fall into its own bin. In a uniform distribution every number in the overall range of the numbers occurs exactly the same number of times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Perfect uniform distribution – each number between 1 and 100 occurs the same number of times (10 times), as you can see from the height of the bars\n\n\n\nOur current example deals with integers, but in general when we have numerical variables, we will deal with numbers that also have a fractional part. Histograms work in the same way for those too, except that we cannot have one bin for each distinct value as there is potentially an inficite number of values in any range.\nFigure 3.2 shows an example of a set of numbers distributed approximately uniformly. For example, Each number does not occur exactly the same number of times, but they are loosely similar. For example, the number 2 seems to appear around 13 times and the number 25 seems to occur around 18 times. In practice, uniformly distributed numbers will look more like Figure 3.2 than Figure 3.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Approximate uniform distribution – each number between 1 and 100 occurs more or less the same number of times\n\n\n\nA numerical variable does not necessarily have to be distributed uniformly. That is each number in the range does not have to occur an equal number of times exactly or approximately. We will now look at some other commmon possibilities.\n\n\n3.1.2 Bell shaped distributions\nFigure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 show two bell shaped distributions. Both have their peaks around the middle of the range between 1 and 100. Which means that numbers closer to the middle – or closer to 50 – occur more frequently than those far away from 50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Symmetric bell shaped distribution with a peak at around 50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Symmetric bell shaped distribution with a peak at around 50 and higher spread than in Figure 3.3\n\n\n\nBoth Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 show bell shaped distributions that are also symmetric. That is, the shape to the left of the peak is approximately similar to the shape on the right.\nSo, both of these are bell shaped and symmetric, and yet they are obviously different? Can you describe how they are different?\nWe see that the spread* of the numbers is quite different. In Figure 3.3 the numbers are more concentrated near the middle than is the case in Figure 3.4. Consequently, the peak in the first figure is higher. For example, the numbers 47 and 51 occur nearly 50 times. In Figure 3.4, the higest frequency is around 35. We call the ends of the bell shae as tails. We see that Figure 3.4 has fatter tails.\nWe have seen three different possibilities for how a set of 1000 numbers in the range 1 to 100 can be distributed. Even though the averages of a set of numbers and even their range might be the same they can still be distributed very differently.\n\n\n3.1.3 Multi-modal distributions\nIn Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 we saw distributions that each had a single peak. This does not have to be the case. shows a case where we have two peaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Distribution with more than one peak – multi-modal distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Skewed distributions\nThus far, we have seen distributions in which the shape has always been symmetric – explicitly so in the bell-shaped examples, but also tru for the uniform examples. Figure 3.6 and Figure 3.7 show examples of asymmetric distributions. The first has a long tail on the right and is said to be right-skewed and the second has its tail on the left and is said to be left-skewed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Asymmetric distribution with a right skew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Asymmetric distribution with a left skew",

    "text": "3.2 Violin plots\nNow that we have clarified the idea of a distribution let us look at distributions of numerical variables through violin plots. These plots serve the same function as the histograms we have looked at in the previous section, but we can do more. Let us start off by looking at a violin plot of the variable minutes from the Boston_marathon data frame\n\nBoston_marathon |&gt; \n  point_plot(minutes ~ 1, annot = \"violin\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Violin plot of the minutes variable from the Boston_marathon data frame\n\n\n\n\n\nThe width of the violin at any point on the y-axis shows the relative frequency of data values close to that point. The widest part of the violin occurs at around 145 minutes. This means that the maximum concentration of winning times in the dataset is close to 145 minutes. The plot does not tell us exactly what the frequency is. The width only shows the relative frequency. Looking at where the violin is very narrow, we can say that very few runners took more than 175 minutes to complete the race. Also, relatively low number sof people took less than about 125 minutes. We can see a higher density of points around the broad regions of the violin and a low density in the narrow areas of the violin.\n\n3.2.1 Elements of the plot\nUntil now, the plots we have generated using point plot have only shown the actual points. However, in Figure 3.8 we see two distinct elements:\n\na jittered plot of the individual points\na violin-shaped solid area – an annotation encompassing the points themselves\n\nThe points represent the raw data and the violin adds an annotation that interprets the data in some way. Here, the interpretation is a violin plot that hels us visualize the distribution of the values.\n\n\n3.2.2 Examining the code\nWe examine the code now. In the code for Figure 3.8, we can see two arguments for the point_plot function. The first argument specifies the tilde expression mapping the axes. The second specifies the type of annotation we want. Figure 3.9 shows the code with the two arguments labeled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: The code to generate Figure 3.8 passes two arguments to the point_plot function – a tilde expression and an annotation specification\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10 explains the tilde expression used for the plot. Mapping of minutes to the y-axis conforms to what we did before. This plot deals with just a single variable – we have no variable on the x-axis. When there is no variable on the x-axis, we conventionally that by just using “1” for the x-axis variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: The tilde expression of Figure 3.9 we place minutes on the y-axis and since the x-axis has no variable, we just state “1”\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11 explains the second argument in generating a violin plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: We specify that we want a violin annotation",

    "text": "3.3 Violin plots and distribution shapes\nThe violin plot displays vertical reflectional symmmetry. We can get all the information that the plot conveys just by slicing the plot vertically down the middle and looking at either of the two chunks.\nWhen we first talked about the various distribution shapes like uniform, symmatric bell-shaped, and skewed, we used histograms to convey the ideas. We can deduce the same information from violin plots as well. In the next section, we will see a few more examples. We will discuss distribution shapes in the context of those examples.\n\n3.3.1 More examples\nWe see a few more examples to reinforce the idea. Figure 3.12 shows a violin plot of the variable price from the price_demand data frame.\n\nprice_demand |&gt; \n  point_plot(price ~ 1, annot = \"violin\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12: Violin plot of the price variable from the price_demand data frame\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at only the left or right half of Figure 3.12, turn it right by 90 degrees and get rid of the display of the individual points, we get Figure 3.13 – a symmetric bell-shaped distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.13: Violin from Figure 3.12 split and rotated 90 degrees right to reveal the distribution in the form we had seen before\n\n\n\n?fig-violin-balance-from-acct-type-balance-df shows a violin plot of the balance variable from the acct_type_balance data frame.\n\nacct_type_balance |&gt; \n  point_plot(balance ~ 1, annot = \"violin\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.14: Violin plot of the balance variable from the acct_type_balance data frame\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from Figure 3.12 that price is bell-spaped and unimoda,but not symmetric. It is skewed towards the lower values because the tail is at the bottom. If we slice and rotate it as before then we would say that it is skewed left.\nNext we look at the distribution of advertising_spend_k from the advertising_sales_channel data frame. Figure 3.15 shows the violin plot. From it we see that advertising_spend_k follows a nearly uniform distribution, but not poerfectly so. It is mildly bimodal.\n\nadvertising_sales_channel |&gt; \n  point_plot(advertising_spend_k ~ 1, annot = \"violin\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.15: Violin plot of the advertising_spend_k variable from the advertising_sales_channel data frame",

A data frame with data on employees of a company might have a column named “salary” to store the salaries of employees. Salaries of employees vary. That is, we know that not everyone in the company has the same salary (generally speaking). So, it makes eminent sense to call a column a “variable.”\nSimilarly, the same data frame might have another column named “Position” that stores the position of each employee. Some example values might be “Manager”, “Sales associate”, and “IT Specialist.” Here too we see “variability” because not all the values in the column are the same. So the term “variable” applies to columns whether they contain numeric or categorical values. However, for the rest of this document, we concern ourselves only with numerical variables.",

If a column has no variation, then we cannot make much use of the information in the column. When a column does have variation, we often want to know the extent of variation in the values of the column. We want to ascribe a specific number – that is, measure the variation in a column. We call this measure the variance of the values in a column. When the numbers in a column are all the same, then we say that the column has no variance – that is, the variance is zero.\nConsider the following three sets of 8 numbers each:Set 1: (1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1)Set 2: (2, 6, 8, 2, 9, 2, 10, 9)Set 3: (1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4)Which of the three sets has the highest amount of variation? That is, which set has numbers that differ by the most (among the three sets)?\nCan you order the sets in increasing order of their overall variability?\nOverall, we can see that the numbers in Set 1 are much closer to each other than those in the other two sets. The numbers in Set 2 are the furthest apart from each other and those in Set 3 are in-between. Therefore the order is: Variance of Set 1 &lt; Variance of Set 3 &lt; Variance of Set 2",

    "section": "4.3 Measuring Variation through variance",
    "text": "4.3 Measuring Variation through variance\nFrom the foregoing, we see that the variance of a set of numbers is a measure of how much the numbers differ from each other. A set of numbers in which the elements are generally very close together has a low variance and a set that contains numbers that differ from each other by a lot has high variance. Over and above just describing what low and high variance look oike, we would like to assign a specific number to the variance of a set of numbers.\nIn reality we will compute the variance using the R function . We describe two procedures below just to give you a good feel for what the variance represents.\n\n4.3.1 Computing Variance: Method 1 – Using pairwise differences\nWe first look at an intuitive (but impractical) method for computing the variance of a set of numbers. Variance represents how different each member of a set of numbers is from the rest. So the difference between each number and the rest of them plays a central role. Our first approach to computing the variance involves looking at every possible pair of numbers in our set and seing how different the two numbers of the pair are from each other. We then combine all of these pairwise differences into a single number to represent the overall variability inthe set.\n\n4.3.1.1 Steps to compute variance using pairwise differences\nLet us assume that we want to compute the variance of the set of 4 num bers (2, 4, 5, 9)\nWhat are the characteristics of a set of numbers with zero variance? Think a little before reading on.\nIf the variance has to be zero then. the average of the differences also has to be zero, which means each of the differences has to be zero. That in turn means that all the numbers have to be the same. This makes a lot of sense, because if there is zero or no variance, then the numbers do not vary!\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Computing Variance: Method 2 – Using deviations from the mean\nWe can also compute the variance using a different aproach – which also gives the same result as method 1. Most people will use this description of variance. Here, instead of finding the pairwise differences, we see how much each number in our set differs from the average (referred to in statistics as the mean). We then combine these individual differences into a number that represents the overall variance in the set.\nAgain, we use the same set of numbers (2, 4, 5, 9). Let us suppose that these numbers represent the prices of some items in a shop (in the US) and therefore they represent USD amounts.\n\n4.3.2.1 Steps to compute variance using deviations from the mean\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Unit of measurement for variance\nWhenever me measure anything, we measure it in terms of some unit of measurement. For example, we might use meter as the unit of measurement for people’s heights, and USD as the unit of measurement for US company profits. In fact, in any data frame, whenever we see a numerical variable, we need to be aware of its unit of measurement.\n\n\n4.3.4 Computing Variance: Preferred Method – Using R!\nWe have a data frame named variance_example that has a variable num with the values (2, 4, 5, 9). We can use the following R code to compute its variance.\n\nvariance_example |&gt; \n  summarize(num_var = var(num))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nHere is another example using the mpg data frame to compute the variance of one of its variables.\n\nmpg |&gt;\n  summarize(hwy_var = var(hwy))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn the previous section we computed the variance of a set of numbers that represented USD values. What are the units for variance?\nIn the two methods where we computed the variance, we found some differences in each step. These differences were differences between USD amounts and hence the differences have units of USD. We then squared the differences. The unit of measurement for the squares wiuld be USD-squared. We then averaged these in one approach and divided by a number in the other approach to get the variance. Therefore, variance also has USD-squared as its unit of measurement.\nIn general, when we compute the variance of a variable measured in some units (say, u, the variance has u-squared as its unit of measurement. That is, if we have a variable expressed in meters, then the variance of the variable will be in meters-squared.\nWe generally have a clear mental notion of units like USD and meters, but not units like USD-sauared or meters-squared.",

Statisticians have therefore given us another measure of variability that has the same units as the original variable. This is the standard deviation and we compute it as the square-root of the variance.\nIf a variable is measured in inches, its variance has inches-squared as its unit. However, when we compute its square root, we get the standard deviation with inches as units.\nWe can now mentally relate the original variable values to the standard deviation and therefore statisticians use this measure vey widely. This is not to say that variance is not widely used as well. It is, and we will use it extensively in this course as well.\n\n4.4.1 Computing standard deviation using R\nWe can use the sd function inside the sumamrize function to compute the standard deviation\nLet us comnpute the standard deviation of the city mileage (variable cty) in the mpg data frame.\n\nmpg |&gt;\n  summarize(cty_sd = sd(cty))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nJust to confirm that the computed standard deviation is in fact the square root of the variance let us compute both.\n\nmpg |&gt;\n  summarize(cty_var = var(cty), cty_sd = sd(cty))",

    "text": "6.3 What is a model?\nPeople us ethe word model in many senses. In one of the more common usages, a model is an approximate representation of something for some purpose.\nFigure 6.1 and Figure 6.2 show the image of a house and a miniature model of it. The miniature is a good representation of the house in some respoects. For example, it depicts the overall shape and some exterior details quite accurately. If someone were about to build a new house and the architect showed them this model, they would get a good idea about the overall external appearance of the house and the color scheme as well. However, this model differs from the actual house in many ways as well – one cannot actually step inside it! We cannot get a feel for how roomy the interios=r will feel. We do not know how the house will look in its actual surroundings. It is accurate in some respects and inaccurate in others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Picture of a house\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Model of the house in Figure 6.1\n\n\n\nShould we consider the model in Figure 6.2 good? In the words of statistician George E. P. Box, “All models are wrong. But some are useful for certain purposes.”\nAll models are wrong in the sense that they are only representations. However, as the miniature model of the house in Figure 6.2, they can still be useful for some purpose.\nWe will be building many models in this course and should remember the folloiwng:\n\nModels are simplifications: They inherently omit details and idealize reality to make complex systems manageable.\nUtility over accuracy: The goal isn’t perfect truth, but practical application and insight for a specific goal, whether it’s scientific, business, or everyday decision-making.\nContext matters: A model’s usefulness depends on the purpose; a simple model might be great for a quick estimate, while a complex one is needed for detailed forecasting.\nPragmatic approach: We should focus on how wrong a model can be and still be helpful, rather than getting stuck on its imperfections.\n\nHow to apply this philosophy:\n\nQuestion your models: Continuously ask how and where a model breaks down.\nUnderstand its limitations: Know the assumptions and simplifications behind the model.\nAdapt and evolve: Be willing to refine or discard models as new information emerges or situations change.",

    "section": "6.4 Mathematical models",
    "text": "6.4 Mathematical models\nIn this course, we will be building a specific kind of models – statistical models. However, before getting to statistical models, we will consider some simpler mathematical models. The term mathgematical model can connote many different things. Let us clarify the sense in which we use the term. Suppose I have a data frame with data about many homes. For each home, we have its age, floor-area_sqft, number_of_bedrooms, number_of_bathrooms, and price.\nWe might build a model to determine the value of price given the values of one or more of the other variables. Remember, this is a model and so we do not expect it be be exact. We do not aim for the model not determininbg the actual price, but only to compute a good estimate of the price. (We have obviously simplified the situation for pedagogical purposes. House prices depend on many other factors. But that need not hold us back. You will still learn the underlying concepts.) S, what might the model look like? Equation 6.1 shows the model. For now, do not worry about how we arrived the model.\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{price}} = 61{,}399 + 394\\,\\text{floor\\_area\\_sqft}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nIn the model, we have placed a hat over price because the model computes not the actual price of a home with the specified floor area and instead only computes an estimate. In statistics, we place a hat over quantities that estimate other quantities.\nEquation 6.1 shows a linear model. We call it linear because all variables are only raised to the fist power. We have not squared or raised a variable to any other power. In this course we build only linear models.\nIn our context, we use the term model to denote a mathematical equation of the kind that Equation 6.1 shows. Our models help us to determine the value of a variable in a data frame for any given instance. Specifically, in the house price example that we just considered, the model in Equation 6.1 enables us to estimate the price of a home, given its floor area.\n\n6.4.1 Response and Explanatory variables\nWe call the variable whose value the model estimates as the response variable. The variables based on which the model estimates the reponse variable are called explanatory variables. We can also refer to the response variable as the dependent variable, and explanatory variables as independent variables.\n\n\n6.4.2 Using the model\nThe house in the fifth row of the data frame has floor area of 1480. Its actual price is $553,000. What price does the model estimate? Well, we can plug the floor area into the model – Equation 6.1 – and find out. If we plug it in, we get $645,999. The model overestimates this price.\nThe house in the fourteenth row of the data frame has floor area of 1293 Its actual price is $561,000. What price does the model estimate? Well, we can plug the floor area into the model – Equation 6.1 – and find out. If we plug it in, we get $572,134. Quite close.\nYou should try out some more cases and wee how the model does. We will learn a lot more about such models, including precisely measuring their quality as we go forward.\nI won’t blame you if you are wondering “We already have the prices in the data frame. Why do we need a model to calculate these?”\nConsider again the home in the fifth row. Why did the model overestimate the price? Well, you should consider that this particular home was not the only one whose floor area was in the vicinity of 1480. The dataset has other homes with similar floor areas and their prices vary. If we look at homes that have floor areas between 1430 and 1530, we see that their proces range from $553,000 to $647,000. In fact, many homes below 1480 square feet in floor area have higher prices. How could that be? Well, variables other than floor area play a role in price too. So our model makes an estimate based on the whole data frame.\nThe next section addresses two main uses of models.",

    "text": "6.5 Purpose of a model\nWe use models in two main ways:\n\nPrediction: Suppose we have built a model using the data in a data frame to estimate the price of a home, given its floor_area_sqft. We can potentially use this model to estimate the price of any home whose floor area we know and shose price we do not know – even if this home is not in the dataset.\nExplanation: Our model in Equation 6.1 tells us that the price of a home is related to its floor area. This makes sense and we could have said this even without a model. However, when people gather data about phenomena that they do not fully understand, and want to understand, they often build models to understand and explain which variables seem to be related and in what way to a variable of interest.\n\nYou might have noted that both of the above purposes actually require us to use a model in contexts that go outside the data that we based the model on. When we start using models outside of the data we used to build the model, we come face to face with the essence of statistics. We will get to that later in the course.",

    "text": "6.6 Average is a model too!\nIn Equation 6.1, we had a response variable and an explanatory variable. What if we do not have any explanatory variable? In the context of our home prices example, not having an explanatory variable is equivalent to saying:\n\n“I have a dataset of 100 homes”\n“Here are their prices”\n“I am not telling you anything else about these homes”\n“I have selected a random home from my dataset”\n“Guess the price of the home I nhave in mind”\n\nBased on the game we played at the start of this chapter, you first compute the average of the prices as $733,440. Your best model to make your guess is:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{price}} = 733{,}440\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\nThat is, like in the game we played, no matter which home I choose, you always state the average as your guess.\nThe big difference between the models in Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 is that the second one has no explanatory variable. When we are not given any additional helpful information to estimate a value, our best estimate – best model – is the average!\nNow you know why I titled the chapter The Simplest Model",
