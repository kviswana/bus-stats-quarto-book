# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book accompanies the course *Introduction to Business Statistics* at
Stillman School of Business. It takes inspiration from *Lessons in Statistical
Thinking* and builds on two core teaching principles:

1. **Students understand structure before uncertainty.**
2. **Regression is the central statistical tool for business.**

The book is organized into 12 modules reflecting this storyline.
